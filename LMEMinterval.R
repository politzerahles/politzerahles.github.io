formula	# This convenience function calculates LMEM-based "confidence" intervals for
	#	a given design and dataset. 
	# Parameters:
	#	formula: a usual model formula, with one DV and one or more IVs. Currently
	#		this function is able to handle functions in DVs (e.g., using log(RT)
	#		rather than RT as a DV), but not in IVs. And I haven't done much testing
	#		of DVs with functions so there may be bugs; I prefer just creating a 
	#		new column in the data frame (e.g., creating a logRT column).
	#		Also note that this is currently only implemented for single-factor
	#		designs. If you have a factorial (e.g. 2x2) design, this function will
	#		collapse it into a single-factor (e.g. 1x4) design.
	#	data: a data frame with repeated measures data
	#	conf: The confidence level (between 0 and 1) for the CI. Defaults .95.
	#	diff.adj: Whether to calculate a difference-adjusted interval (T, the default)
	#		or a regular interval (F).

	### The rest of the code handles making  CIs of the scaled data. The

	###	an lmer	model to the scaled data. To make the models more likely to 
	###	converge, we want to fit the models without random correlation 
	###	parameters; to do this use a hack from https://rpubs.com/Reinhold/22193,
	###	which requires first calculating a temporary model [which may not 
	###	converge] and then extracting dummy coefficients directly from
	###	its model matrix to construct the good model.
	###	Finally, we get lmerTest dfs to calculate the CI

	#  be used.
	#	We also specify no random intercepts; because the data are scaled, every
