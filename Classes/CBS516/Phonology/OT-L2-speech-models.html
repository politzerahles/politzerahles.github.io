		<h2>Optimality Theory and L2 speech models (2 hours)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">For this final activity, read <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>either one</strong></span></em>
			of the two readings [PDF] below. (You can do both if you want to, but you are only required to do one.) Then
			continue on to do a reflection.</p>
<ul class="center">
<li><a alt="" href="Basics_of_OT.pdf">Basics_of_OT.pdf</a>: Optimality Theory is a completely different way of doing
	phonology&mdash;it's a different approach than what we discussed in the previous activities. It is also a powerful analysis
	method for explaining, and predicting, patterns that can happen in language learning, language disorders, etc.</li>
<li><a alt="" href="SLM and PAM.pdf">SLM and PAM.pdf</a>: The Speech Learning Model and Perceptual Assimilation Model are two
	related models of how second language learners pronounce and perceive the sounds of their second language; both use concepts
	from phonology to make predictions about what things will cause difficulty for learners.</li>
</ul>
		<p class="centercol">To finish up, Write a brief reflection about your learning in this module (including your reading
			about Optimality Theory and/or about the Speech Learning Model and Perceptual Assimilation Model).</p>

	<p class="centercol">When you finish this activity, you are done with the module (assuming all your work on this and the
			previous tasks has been satisfactory). You can <a href="index.html">return to the module homepage</a> to review this
			module, or <a href="../index.html">return to the class homepage</a> to select a different module or assignment to do now.</p>
