		<h2>Syntactic differences between main verbs and auxiliary verbs: Negation placement (0.5 hours)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">In English, main verbs and auxiliary verbs do not just express different aspects of meaning;
			they also follow different rules in syntax. In this activity you will discover one example of these differences.</p>

		<button class="collapsible">Where can negation go?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Let's think about where we can put negation in an English sentence.</p>
			<p>Consider the following sentence:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><em>He might like Jay Chou</em>.</p>
			<p>Now let's put the negation word "<em>not</em>" into this sentence.</p>
			<p>Where can you put "<em>not</em>" in this sentence? List all the possibilities.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">Where can negation go? (2)</button>
		<div class="content">
<p>The only possible way to negate that sentence was: <em>He might <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> like Jay Chou.</em></p>
<p>From this, maybe we can conclude that the place to put negation in English is right before the main verb ("like").</p>
<p>Let's test that out. Try to negate the following sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>He is an alien</em>.</li>
<li><em>He eats pie.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Does the "put&nbsp;<em>not</em> before the main verb" rule work for these sentences? If not, why? Where does negation go in these two sentences?</p>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">Summary</button>
		<div class="content">
<p>The negated version of <em>He is an alien</em> is <em>He is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> an</em> <em>alien</em>. Therefore, we can't claim that negation goes before the verb of the sentence. In this case, it comes after.</p>
<p>But for <em>He eats pie</em>, we can't put negation after the verb:&nbsp;<em>*He eats <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></em> <em>pie </em>is not grammatical in modern English. (Interestingly, though, this was grammatical in older versions of English, such as Middle English [such as the English used by Chaucer in the 14th century.) Instead, we have to say <em>He does&nbsp;</em>.</p>
<p>Try to state a rule about where negation can go in English, with respect to the verb. Keep in mind the distinction between main verbs and auxiliary verbs (which kind of verb is <em>is</em>, and which kind of verb is <em>eats</em>?). Don't search for a rule online; the purpose of this activity is for you to try thinking of a rule yourself. I don't care if your answer is correct or not, I just care that your answer demonstrates <em>your own thinking</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
