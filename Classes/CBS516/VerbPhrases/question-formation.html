		<h2>Syntactic differences between main verbs and auxiliary verbs: Negation placement (0.5 hours)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">In English, main verbs and auxiliary verbs do not just express different aspects of meaning;
			they also follow different rules in syntax. In this activity you will discover one example of these differences.</p>


		


		<center>

		<button class="collapsible">How do we make questions?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Let's think about how we can form questions from an English sentence.</p>
			<p>Consider the following sentence:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><em>He is angry</em>.</p>
			<p>How would you turn this sentence into a question? List all the possibilities.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">How do we make questions? (2)</button>
		<div class="content">
<p>The two possibilities I could think of are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Is he angry?</em></li>
<li><em>He is angry? </em>(asked with rising question intonation)</li>
</ol>
<p>For now we will ignore #2 and just focus on #1.</p>
<p>From this example we could conclude that the way to make a question in English is to <em>move</em> the verb to the beginning of the sentence.</p>
<p>Now consider this sentence:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>He eats pie</em>.</p>
<p>How would you make this into a question? Does it support or challenge my previous conclusion ("the way to make a question in English is to move the verb to the beginning of the sentence")?</p>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">Summary</button>
		<div class="content">
<p>In the previous question, you should have noticed that saying <em>*Eats he pie?</em> is not ok. Instead, the correct question is <em>Does he eat pie?</em></p>
<p>Thus, my previous generalization ("you make a question by moving the verb to the beginning of the sentence").</p>
<p>Try to state a rule about how verbs in English move to create questions. Keep in mind the distinction between main verbs and auxiliary verbs (which kind of verb is <em>is</em>, and which kind of verb is <em>eats</em>?). Don't search for a rule online; the purpose of this activity is for you to try thinking of a rule yourself. I don't care if your answer is correct or not, I just care that your answer demonstrates <em>your own thinking</em>.</p>
