		<h2>Types of grammar (0.5 hours)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>


		<p class="centercol">As discussed in an earlier task, grammar is not just about sentences, verb endings, and
			stuff like that. Grammar is every aspect of the system governing how language works. Let's take a moment
			to look at what different kinds of "grammar" there are in a language. This will also be useful because the
			kinds of grammar match very closely to the different subfields of linguistics (things like "syntax",
			"phonetics", etc.) and the modules of this subject.</p>

		<center>

		<button class="collapsible">Identify different types of grammar</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Looking at the chapter you read in part 2 of this module, or at any other resources you can find, fill in the
				blanks below with the names of different subfields of linguistic study.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Descriptive grammar rules about how sounds work and go together are part of ____ and ____.</li>
				<li>Descriptive grammar rules about how words are created are part of ____.</li>
				<li>Descriptive grammar rules about how different words are put together to make a sentence are part of ____.</li>
				<li>Descriptive grammar rules about how meanings are put together to express a more specific idea are part of ____.</li>
				<li>Descriptive grammar rules about how speakers and context influence the meaning of language are part of ____.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you're finished, you can click below to check your answers.</p>
