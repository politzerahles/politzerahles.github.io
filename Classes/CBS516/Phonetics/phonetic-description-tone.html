		<h2>Phonetic description of tone (1 hour)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">So far we have only discussed how to describe <em>consonants</em> phonetically.
			What about Chinese tones?</p>
		<p class="centercol">All the problems we saw for describing vowels and consonants (in the first activity of this module)
			also exist for describing tones. For many Chinese languages, the tones do have names or labels (such as "tone 1",
			"tone 2", etc., or the more classical labels like &#x9634;&#x5e73;&#x3001;&#x9633;&#x5e73;&#x3001;&#x4e0a;&#x58f0;&#x3001;&#x53bb;&#x58f0;&#x3001;
			etc.). But these category labels cannot describe subtle differences in pronunciation. For example, think about the
			Mandarin pronunciation of &#x99ac; when it's spoken by itself, vs. when it's spoken as the first syllable of a
			compount word (like &#x99ac;&#x8def;). These are both "Tone 3", but many people pronounce them differently&mdash;when
			pronouncing &#x99ac; by itself their pitch goes down and then back up, whereas when pronouncing it within the word
			&#x99ac;&#x8def; their pitch just goes down and doesn't rise again, like in this example:
			<audio controls="controls"><source src="ma.wav" type="audio/wav" /></audio></p>
		<p class="centercol">So, just like for consonants and vowels, we also need a phonetic way to describe tone. Go through the
			activities below to learn how we can do that.</p>
	

		<center>

		<button class="collapsible">Chao letters and Mandarin</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>A common way of representing tones, especially among Chinese researchers, is the system called
				<em>Chao letters</em>, named after Yuen Ren Chao (&#x8d99;&#x5143;&#x4efb;). You use a scale from 1 to 5,
				where 1 represents the lowest pitch and 5 represents the highest pitch. Then, you describe any tone by
				describing its start and end pitch (and, if necessary, the middle pitch). For example, Tone 1 in Standard
				Mandarin (e.g. the tone of &#x6536;) is "55": it starts very high and it ends very high. Tone 2 (e.g., the tone
				of &#x719f;) is 35: it starts medium, and then it rises and ends high. Tone 3 (e.g., the tone of &#x624b;)
				is 213: it starts kind of low, gets even lower, and then it rises up again.</p>
			<p>(I don't know why they're called "Chao letters", since they're numbers, but whatever! I think the original
				version of this system used musical notes [like C, B, etc.] instead of numbers.)</p>
			<p><strong>Based on the above description, how would you represent Mandarin Tone 4 using Chao letters?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>And what about&nbsp;&#x99ac; when it's in front of another syllable (as in <strong>&#x99ac;</strong>&#x8def;),
				discussed at the beginning of this activity; how would you represent that?</strong></p>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">Chao letters and Cantonese</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Describe the six tones of Cantonese (specifically, the variety of Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong) using
				Chao letters. If you speak Cantonese, you can try figuring them out on your own. If you don't speak
				Cantonese, you can ask a Cantonese-speaking friend to pronounce the tones for you, or you can look up
				examples online and listen to them.</p>
			<p>(Note: some people say Cantonese has six tones, and some people say it has nine. The correct answer is six.
				To understand why, we'll need concepts from phonology, so we'll talk more about this in the Phonology module.)</p>
		</div>

		</center>

		<p class="centercol">When you have finished these activities, continue to the next section of the module: 
			<a href="phonetic-description-signed-languages.html">"Phonetic description in signed languages"</a>.</p>


<p class="txtUpsideDown">Answers for Mandarin practice: Tone 4 is canonically '51'. &#x99ac; in &#x99ac;&#x8def; is 21.
<br /><br />Answers for Cantonese: The canonical tones are 55 (&#x5206;), 35 (e.g. &#x7c89;), 33 (e.g. &#x8a13;), 21 (e.g. &#x711a;), 12 (e.g. &#x596e;), and 22 (e.g. &#x4efd;).
