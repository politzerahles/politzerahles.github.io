		<h2>Different kinds of priming experiments (4 hours)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">You should have noticed that the trials with codes in the 100s always consisted of two words with related meanings
	(such as <em>BEE</em> and <em>BUTTERFLY</em>), whereas the trials with codes in the 200s always consisted of two words with unrelated
	meanings (such as <em>EDIT</em> and <em>BUTTERFLY</em>).</p>
<p class="centercol">This is called a <em>priming experiment</em>. The first word that you see (the <em>prime</em>) influences how quickly
	you can react to the second word (the <em>target</em>). Simplifying a lot, the idea here is that the representations of words in your
	mind can be more or less "active", and when one word representation becomes active then its activation also spreads to closely
	related words. The details of how and why this happens aren't important for now (if you take a psycholinguistics class you will
	probably learn much more of this). The important thing is that we can use participants' reaction speed to learn something about
	the relationships between words: if one word primes (i.e., helps you react faster to) another word, that indicates that seeing the
	first word increased the activation of the second word, and that in turn indicates that these words share some important connection
	(at least, more so than whatever control pair of words you compared this to).</p>

<h4 class="centercol">Exploring other kinds of priming experiments</h4>
<p class="centercol">There are a lot of different ways to do a priming experiment&mdash;there are different kinds of relationships between
	prime and target words, different ways you can present the primes and targets, and different tasks you can make the participants do
	in order to measure their reaction time. These may all affect the results. For example, the experiment you did used associative
	priming (when the prime and target have related meanings&mdash;more specifically, when the prime is a word that is closely associated
	with the target, or vice versa), and in associative priming experiments a target is responded to faster if it's preceded by a related
	prime and responded to slower if it's preceded by an unrelated prime. In other types of priming experiments, related primes might not
	speed up (or might even slow down) reactions to the target.</p>
<p class="centercol">Below I have provided a list of different kinds of priming experiments relationships and different ways to do priming
	experiments. After that, I have provided a list of references. We are going to do a scavenger hunt: given this list of features of
	priming experiments, I want you to find examples in published papers from the list of papers I have provided.</p>
<p class="centercol">For each kind of priming experiment, list one paper (<em>from this list</em>) that uses that method, and give a brief
	explanation or example of how it works. (For types of priming relationships, the easiest way to explain is with an
	example&mdash;e.g., you can explain "morphological priming" by giving an example of a prime and a target, and pointing out how they
	are related.) These explanations should be in your own words. For example, for "Associative (semantic)" priming, you might list Zhou
	&amp; Marslen-Wilson (2000), and an explanation like "The meaning of the target is related to the meaning of the prime, such as when
	the prime is &#x536b;&#x751f; ['hygiene'] and the target is &#x6d01;&#x51c0; ['clean']."</p>
<p class="centercol">Remember, you don't need to carefully read every word of every paper! You can just skim the papers to understand the
	basic idea of their experiment design and see which type of priming it is. Being able to identify a particular piece of information
	that you need from a paper, and then skim the paper to find just that information rather than reading the entire thing, is a useful
	research skill, so it will be good to practice it now.</p>
<p class="centercol">It is ok to use the same paper more than once in this activity.</p>
<p class="centercol">There are many different strategies you can use to try to complete this task. You could first look up explanations of
	each thing in the list (e.g., look up the definition of "masked priming", the definition of "mediated priming", etc.) and then
	specifically search for papers that have those. Or you could look at a paper first, and browse the paper until you understand which
	kind of priming it used, and then see where it fits within this list. Or you could use a mixture of these strategies, or another
	strategy you think of.
<p class="centercol">By the end of this activity, you will be familiar with many different ways of doing a priming experiment (and
	hopefully with what their advantages and disadvantages are), and you will have practice with how to read and understand academic
	papers.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">Scavenger hunt</h4>
<p class="centercol">The list below has 12 features of priming experiments to look for. To earn credit for this activity, you must find
	<em><strong>at least 6</strong></em> of them. (If you're feeling ambitious, you can try to find them all!) You may work with up to 2
	partners on this.</p>
<p class="centercol">In order to receive credit, you must have a correct reference and correct (and not plagiarized) example/explanation
	for each item in the list.</p>
