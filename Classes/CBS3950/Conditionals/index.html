		<h2>Conditionals</h2>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="../index.html">&#x21B5; Back to class homepage</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">Conditionals are sentences with "<em>if</em>". They are
			interesting testing grounds for lots of pragmatic issues.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Logical <em>if</em></h3>
		<p class="centercol">In formal logic (e.g. the way it's used in math, philosophy,
			and computer science), "<em>if</em>" has a specific meaning. The best way
			to illustrate it is with a <em>truth table</em>: a table showing what
			the truth value of an expression like "<em>if P, then Q</em>" will be
			in different situations. Here's a truth table for a simple conditional:</p>

		<center>
		<table border="1" width=33% style="text-align: center;">
		<tr><td width=30%><strong><em>P</em></strong></td><td width=30%><strong><em>Q</em></strong></td><td width=40%><strong>"<em>if <em>P</em>, then <em>Q</em>"</strong></td></tr>
		<tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td style="text-align: center">T</td></tr>
		<tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td style="text-align: center">F</td></tr>
		<tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td style="text-align: center">T</td></tr>
		<tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td style="text-align: center">T</td></tr>
		</table>
		</center>

		<p class="centercol">In other words, "<em>if P, then Q</em>" means: if <em>P</em> is true
			then <em>Q</em> must be true, and if <em>P</em> is false then <em>Q</em> could be true or not true.
			We can see this from the truth table: the only way for "<em>if P, then Q</em>"
			to be false is the second row, where <em>P</em> is true but <em>Q</em> is false.</p>		

		<h3 class="centercol"><em>if</em> and downward entailment</h3>
		<p class="centercol">The <em>antecedent</em> of a conditional (i.e., the <em>P</em> part
			in all the examples above) is a downward-entailing environment. In other words, 
			if an <em>if</em> statement with a bigger set in its antecedent is true, then
			a corresponding one with a smaller set in its antecedent must also be true:</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li><em>If you like <strong>cats</strong>, we will be friends.</em></li>
			<li><strong>entails:</strong> <em>If you like <strong>black cats</strong>, we will be friends.</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="centercol">This property makes <em>if</em> statements interact with quantity
			implicatures in interesting ways. As we saw in <a href="../StrongerAlternatives/">the
			module on alternatives</a>, an expression that would be a stronger alternative
			becomes weaker if it's in a downward-entailing context. For example, <em>all</em>
			normally entails <em>some</em>, and thus an utterance like "<em>I finished some
			of the readings</em>" often implies that I did not finish all of the readings.
			But if we put the <em>some</em> expression into the antecedent of a conditional,
			the pattern changes.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Imagine I tell you, "<em>If you finish some of the readings,
			you'll get an A</em>". Does this imply "If you finish some-but-not-all of the
			readings, you'll get an A?" It does not seem to. (Imagine how you would
			feel if you finish all of the readings and I give you an F and say, "I
			didn't promise to give you an A if you finish <em>all</em> of the readings,
			only if you finish <em>some</em> of them." You would probably feel like
			I'm being pretty unfair!)</p>
		<p class="centercol">To see this formally, we can look at truth tables for
			the statement under each interpretation. The below table shows
			six possible scenarios, and shows whether the statement "<em>If
			you finish some of the readings, you'll get an A</em>" is true
			or false under each scenario. The middle column shows the
			truth or falsity of the statement when <em>some</em> is interpreted
			logically (as "more than zero, up to and including all"), and
			the right-hand column shows the truth or falsity when <em>some</em>
			is interpreted as meaning "some but not all".</p>
		
		<center>
		<table border="1" width=33% style="text-align: center;">
		<tr><td><strong>Situation</strong></td><td><strong><em>some</em>-existential</strong></td><td><strong><em>some</em> but not all</strong></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Read all and get an A</td><td>T</td><td>T</tr>
		<tr><td>Read half and get an A</td><td>T</td><td>T</tr>
		<tr><td>Read none and get an A</td><td>T</td><td>T</tr>
		<tr><td>Read all and not get an A</td><td>F</td><td>T</tr>
		<tr><td>Read half and not get an A</td><td>F</td><td>F</tr>
		<tr><td>Read none and not get an A</td><td>T</td><td>T</tr>
		</table>
		</center>

		<p class="centercol">What we can see from this table is that interpreting
			<em>some</em> literally (as "more than zero, up to and including
			all") makes the conditional stronger (more informative) because
			it makes the conditional true in fewer situations. The situations
			in which this interpretation of the conditional is true (the
			middle column) are a subset of the situations in which the
			conditional with a "some-but-not-all" interpretation (the
			right column). That may explain why <em>some</em> does not
			get interpreted as "some but not all" in this context:
			that interpretation would yield a weaker alternative rather
			than a stronger one.</p>
	
		<h3 class="centercol">Complications</h3>
		<p class="centercol">There is a complication, though. In actual
			language use, people don't seem to use <em>if</em> to mean
			what a logical conditional means.</p>
		<p class="centercol">For example, imagine that there are two
			ways to get from your house to your school. One way is to
			walk on the main street, and it generally takes about 10
			minutes. Another way is to cut through a park, and it
			generally takes about 5 minutes. Someone might tell you,
			"<em>If you cut through the park, you can get to school in
			five minutes.</em>"
		<p class="centercol">This is not literally true if we interpret
			<em>if</em> logically. Logically, this statement would mean
			that if you cut through the park you are <em>guaranteed</em>
			to be able to get to school in five minutes. But you can
			probably imagine situations where this does not hold. For
			example, if you cut through the park but there is
			construction blocking the entrance to the school, you might
			not be able to get there in five minutes. Or if you cut
			through the park and fall and break your leg, you might
			not be able to get there in five minutes.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Some analysts (going back at least to
			<a href="https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/85984/WPL_08_June_1971_150.pdf?sequence=1">Geis
			& Zwicky, 1971</a>) have proposed that in natural languages
			we tend to interpret conditionals as if they mean "<em>if
			and only if</em>". In other words, "<em>If P, then Q</em>"
			gets interpreted as "<em>If P, then Q; and if Q, then P</em>".
			Or, equivalently: "<em>If P, then Q; and if not P, then not
			Q</em>". (If you want to see how these are equivalent, try
			making truth tables for "if Q, then P" and for "if not P,
			then not Q". Or, think about how "if Q, then P" means that
			the only way for P to be false is if Q is also false.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">This seems like a more accurate description
			of the example above; what it seems to mean is that the
			only way to get to campus in five minutes is to take the
			shortcut through the park. In other words, if you don't
			take the shortcut through the park, you won't make it
			to campus in five minutes (<em>if not P, then not Q</em>);
			or, equivalently, if you made it to campus in five minutes,
			then you must have taken the shortcut through the park
			(<em>if Q, then P</em>). This also seems to work for
			similar examples like "<em>If you mow the lawn, I'll
			pay you $5</em>" (we usually interpret this as meaning
			that the speaker won't pay us $5 if we don't mow the lawn).</p>
		<p class="centercol">Some theories have proposed (see, e.g., Levinson,
			chapter 2) 
		<p class="centercol">In fact it seems to me that the natural-language
			interpretation of a condition is not even "<em>if and only if</em>",
			but just "<em>only if</em>". As already discussed above,
			"<em>if you cut through the park, you can get to school in
			five minutes</em>" does not seem to mean that cutting through
			the park <em>guarantees</em> you'll reach campus in five minutes;
			rather, it seems to mean that cutting through the park <em>is
			required</em> in order to get to campus in five minutes. So,
			this is closer to meaning "<em>only if</em> you cut through the park
			can you get to school in five minutes" than to "<em>if and only if</em>
			you cut through the park can you get to school in five minutes."
			In fact, we can imagine counterexamples that make any of these
			conditionals false (above we imagined situations where you
			could cut through the park but still not make it to school in
			five minutes; conversely, we could imagine situations where you
			don't get to the park but do get to school in five minutes,
			e.g., if you take the long route but run top speed), but the
			condition feels to me like it is intended to communicate
			<em>only if</em>.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Let's return to the initial example of "<em>If
			you do some of the readings, you'll get an A</em>". To me, this
			really seems to be communicating an <em>only if</em> sense;
			it doesn't sound like it's guaranteeing that you'll get an
			A (because, for example, if you do some of the readings but
			you also cheat and plagiarize something, or if you do some
			of the readings but you drop the class, then you won't get
			an A). It sounds more like doing all the readings is
			necessary, but not sufficient, for getting an A.</p>
		<p class="centercol">To see how this works with "<em>some</em>",
			let's try some truth tables again. First, a truth table
			for what happens if we interpret the "<em>if</em>" as
			"<em>only if</em>" (i.e., "only if you do some of the
			readings can you get an A", or equivalently, "if you
			don't do some of the readings, you won't get an A", or
			equivalently, "to get an A, you have to have done some
			of the readings"):</p>
