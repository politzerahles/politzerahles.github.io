		<h2>Experimental pragmatics</h2>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="../index.html">&#x21B5; Back to class homepage</a></p>
		
		<p class="centercol">Throughout this class so far, the method we've been using
			to analyze pragmatics has mostly been <em>introspection</em>: we think about
			what various utterances might mean and we think about what we might say in
			various situations, and we use those ideas to support or criticize theories
			of pragmatics. (This approach is sometimes derisively called "armchair
			linguistics", because you can do it while relaxing in an armchair.) Another
			method we've used is <em>observation</em>: noticing interesting examples in
			the real world and thinking about how they support or challenge pragmatic
			theories.</p>
		<p class="centercol">In recent decades, though, there has been an increasing
			interest in doing controlled empirical <em>experiments</em> to study
			pragmatics. Hence a new field of study, <em>experimental pragmatics</em>,
			in which researchers use the methods and techniques of experimental
			psychology to figure out how pragmatics works and to try to solve
			questions and problems that so far have not been solved through traditional
			methods of introspection and observation. "Experimental pragmatics" started
			to be recognized as a field in the early 2000s, and really exploded into
			a major area of research in the 2010s and onward; for example, in 2021 the
			XPrag research network organized <a href="https://www.xpragit.com/20-years.html">a symposium</a>
			commemorating "20 years of experimental pragmatics".</p>
		<p class="centercol">(Note that here I'm using the term "experiment" to mean
			collecting data from lots of people in a controlled survey or test. It's
			different from "observation" because it involves the researcher setting
			up different conditions&mdash;e.g. seeing how people interpret a certain	
			sentence in different contexts&mdash;whereas observation depends on
			just finding things as-is in the real world. And I'm also treating it
			as different from "introspection" because it involves the collection of
			observable data from other people, rather than the collection of the
			researcher's own intuitions. Technically, from a philosophy-of-science
			perspective, introspection might also be an "experiment", but that's
			not the sense in which I'm using the term here. Practically speaking,
			and at risk of oversimplifying a bit, "experiments" usually involve
			computers or at least paper-pencil surveys.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">Experimental pragmatics is a vast topic which we could
			easily spend a whole semester (or more) on. It's also a topic that's near
			and dear to my own heart, because it's the kind of research I've done; my own
			<a href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/12280">doctoral dissertation</a>
			is a set of pragmatics experiments (even though I have <a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lnc3.12401">since
			come to believe that much of my initial research was misguided</a>). For this
			module, though, let's
			limit ourselves to two closely related case studies. (For more information
			on experimental pragmatics you should read Noveck, which is a great
			overview of the field; chapters 6 and 7 in particular are about the
			same sort of cases as what this  module will examine.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">To learn about experimental pragmatics, we'll look at
			two experiments that are nice examples of this field. Both experiments
			are about scalar implicatures. So before we look at the experiments,
			let's take a quick look at what scalar implicatures are and what are
			some of the challenging questions about scalar implicatures that needed
			to be addressed through experimentation.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Scalar implicatures</h3>
		<p class="centercol">Throughout many of the previous modules we've revisited the
			same made-up example, in which Rebecca says "<em>Josh is smart</em>" and
			thereby implicates that she thinks Josh is not brilliant.</p>
		<p class="centercol">This is an example of one of the most widely discussed
			phenomena in pragmatics, so-called "scalar implicatures". As we've seen,
			scalar implicatures are those that supposedly come from thinking about a stronger
			alternative that the speaker could have said but chose not to say (i.e.,
			Rebecca could have "<em>Josh is brilliant</em>" but for some reason she
			didn't). In particular, "scalar" implicatures are ones where this
			stronger alternative comes from replacing one word in the utterance
			with a stronger word from an ordered "scale" of related words that exists
			in a person's vocabulary. For instance, in this example, maybe we assume
			that Rebecca and the listener both know that the words like <em>brilliant</em>,
			<em>smart</em>, and <em>average</em> form a scale
			&lt;<em>brilliant</em>, <em>smart</em>, <em>average</em>&gt;, from strongest
			to weakest. When Rebecca uses a word that's not the strongest one on
			the scale, the listener wonders why she didn't use a stronger word and
			infers that she doesn't think the stronger word applies. Many other words
			also exist in scales which may trigger scalar implicatures; for instance,
			an utterance like "<em>X or Y</em>" can implicate "X or Y but not both"
			because <em>or</em> is weaker than its scalemate <em>and</em> (&lt;<em>and</em>, <em>or</em>&gt; scale);
			<em>maybe</em> or <em>probably</em> can implicate that something is not
			certain (&lt;<em>certainly</em>, <em>probably</em>, <em>maybe</em>&gt; scale);
			and a &lt;<em>always</em>, <em>sometimes</em>&gt; scale can make
			<em>sometimes</em> implicate "not all the time", as illustrated near the
			beginning of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVWpHTafYuA">this
			funny scene from the movie <em>Best in Show</em></a>.</p>
<!--		<p class="centercol">These scales are sometimes called "Horn scales", after
			Laurence Horn, who was the first to systematically describe and explain
			scalar implicatures from a formal pragmatic perspective (see
			<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-semantic-properties-of-logical-operators-in-Horn/ebed1d0e52d5367f43e8fd8ca6b9b21e62286ada">Horn,
			1972</a>). But people have been aware of this phenomenon for a long time;
			for instance, as Geurts (Introduction) points out, John Stuart Mill
			had described the phenomenon in 1865.</p>-->
		<p class="centercol">Scalar implicatures are probably the biggest topic studied
			in experimental pragmatics, at least in terms of the number of experiments
			that have focused on them. Just like a good friend of mine once derisively told me
			that Cui Jian's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nothing_to_My_Name&oldid=1061781921">Nothing
			to My Name"</a> (&#x4e00;&#x65e0;&#x6240;&#x6709;) is the most over-analyzed
			song in the history of Chinese rock and roll, scalar implicatures are the most
			over-analyzed thing in pragmatics. After having spent a number of years doing
			research on them, I no longer believe they're anything special (see, e.g.,
			Geurts, for discussion on how scalar implicatures just follow from the
			same principles as other implicatures). Nevertheless, they are often a
			useful test case for designing experiments to test various
			theories of pragmatics. Below we will examine two experiments that were
			designed to test two different issues about scalar implicatures. For more
			detailed information about these and other issues, excellent summaries of
			scalar implicature research are available in

			and Geurts.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Case study 1: "embedded implicatures"</h3>
		<p class="centercol">So far our discussions
			of scalar implicature have assumed that they are conversational implicatures
			which arise when a speaker flouts the maxim of quantity. Specifically, our
			treatment has generally assumed that scalar implicatures are a sort of
			<em>generalized conversational implicature</em> which follows from some automatic
			inferential steps that happen in any context; but a very similar analysis
			could still work even if we treat scalar implicatures as <em>particularized
			conversational implicatures</em>. Either way, this is the most traditional
			view of scalar implicatures and it's based on Gricean ideas (although people
			often call the generalized-conversational-implicature view of them "neo-Gricean",
			because it's essentially based on Gricean pragmatics but it's a view that
			was further developed by other researchers after Grice).</p>
		<p class="centercol">This view is controversial, though, and there are other
			theories that propose very different explanations of how scalar implicatures
			work. The one most relevant to this experiment is something called the
			"grammatical theory", which claims that "scalar implicatures" are not
			implicatures at all, but rather they are interpretations based on
			syntax and semantics. According to this theory, scalar words have their literal meaning (e.g.
			<em>sometimes</em> means "at least some of the time", <em>smart</em> means
			"at least smart", etc.), but their meaning gets enriched by a grammatical
			operator when they're used in a syntactic context. You can imagine this
			operator as being like a silent "<em>only</em>"; the idea is that when
			someone says "<em>Josh is smart</em>", there is actually a silent operator
			in the sentence that makes it be interpreted as "<em>Josh is ONLY smart</em>"
			(i.e., only smart but not brilliant). Likewise for any other "scalar" terms;
			for instance, an utterance like "<em>I sometimes remember to floss before
			brushing</em>" gets interpreted as "<em>I ONLY sometimes remember to floss
			before brushing</em>" because of the insertion of this silent operator.
			Crucially, according to the grammatical theory, this process happens in
			syntax and/or semantics, not in pragmatics, and thus "scalar implicatures"
			are not actually implicatures; they are grammatical (syntactic and/or
			semantic) enrichments.</p>
		<p class="centercol">We don't have enough time or space here to get into all the
			details of the debate between these approaches. (But see Geurts, chapters 7-8, and
			Noveck, chapters 6-7, for much more discussion of these.) Let's just focus on
			one. One major point of contention between these theories has
			been the question of whether or not "scalar implicatures" occur in embedded
			contexts. All these theories agree that "scalar implicatures" can
			happen in matrix sentences; i.e., "<em>I regret some of the things I
			said</em>" may be taken to mean "I regret some, but not all, of the
			things I said". Where the theories disagree is on whether that "<em>some</em>"
			will still get interpreted as "not all" if it's in a syntactically embedded clause
			(e.g., "<em>I think the president regrets some of the things
			he said</em>"&mdash;according to the grammatical theory, this should mean
			that the speaker thinks the president does
			not regret all the things he said), or in the scope of another semantic
			operator (e.g., "<em>All of the people involved in the scandal regret some
			of the things they said.</em>"&mdash;according to the grammatical theory this
			should mean that no person involved regrets everything they said, i.e., maybe
			person A regrets 80% of what he said and person B regrets 50% of what she said,
			but there is no person who regrets 100% of what he said.) Some of the pragmatic
			theories, on the other hand, might not
			predict "<em>some</em>" to get interpreted as "not all" in these situations,
			because implicatures 	are supposed to happen at the level of the full utterance
			rather than the level of a particular clause within the utterance (see, however,
			Geurts, chapters 7-8, for an explanation of how these theories can accommodate
			so-called "embedded implicatures" if those sorts of implicatures do indeed
			occur).</p>
		<p class="centercol">This is not really a question that can be answered by introspection,
			because people have very different intuitions about what these utterances mean.
			Researchers tend to be willing to interpret these weird sentences in whatever
			way ends up consistent with their theory. I don't trust my own intuitions with
			very complicated sentences like this; I feel like after a few years of doing
			pragmatics I've seen so many of these that my intuitions are messed up and
			are not the same as what "normal" people's intuitions are.</p>
		<p class="centercol"><a href="https://semprag.org/index.php/sp/article/view/sp.2.4">Geurts
			and Pouscoulous (2009)</a> tested this by designing a clever survey. They showed
			volunteers scenarious and sentences like the one depicted in the figure below. In
			this example (copied from their paper), there is a picture showing three squares
			and three circles. Let's call the square at the top "square A", and the two squares
			at the bottom "square B" and "square C". Square B is connected to two of the circles,
			and Square C is also connected to two of the circles. Crucially, though, Square A
			is connected to <em>all three</em> circles. Along with this picture, the volunteers
			saw the sentence "<em>All of the squares are connected with some of the
			circles</em>"&mdash;i.e., a typical "embedded implicature" sort of example sentence like
			the ones we've seen above. The volunteers were asked to decide whether that sentence
			is true or false, with respect to the picture.</p>
<center><a href="https://semprag.org/index.php/sp/article/view/sp.2.4"><image src="GeurtsPouscoulous2009.png" alt="Figure from Geurts & Pouscoulous experiment; see main text for descrption."/></a></center>
		<p class="centercol">Recall that the "grammatical theory" predicts that the scalar
			implicature should be realized in the embedded context; in other words, people
			should interpret this sentence as meaning "all of the squares are connected with
			not-all of the circles", i.e., no square can be connected to all of the circles.
			Since Square A is connected to all of the circles, people should consider this
			sentence "false", according to the grammatical theory. On the other hand, the
			Gricean theory supposedly predicts that people won't get scalar implicatures
			in this context; in other words, they won't think that "<em>some</em>" has to
			mean "not all" here. Therefore, according to that theory, volunteers should
			consider this sentence "true", even though Square A is connected to all of
			the circles.</p>
		<p class="centercol">In Geurts and Pouscoulous's experiment, every volunteer marked
			this sentence as "true". This seems like strong evidence in favor of the
			Gricean theory and against the grammatical theory. (Or, at the very least,
			strong evidence that people don't interpret "<em>some</em>" as "not all" in
			this context; whether the theories actually predict and explain that is
			a separate question that has been hotly debated in the years since, and
			proponents of the grammatical theory may claim that either (a) their theory
			also predicts this outcome, so Geurts and Pouscoulous actually mis-represented
			the predictions of the grammatical theory; or (b) there was some problem with
			the way the experiment was designed so its results are wrong.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">What makes these results so compelling and important is
			that Geurts and Pouscoulous didn't just sit down and say "I think this
			sentence doesn't mean 'not all', so my theory is right." They went to
			the trouble of designing an experiment and actually collecting data, to
			show that the interpretation predicted by their theory is really the way
			that real people interpret these sentences.</p>
		<p class="centercol">One limitation of these sorts of research is that they
			often rely on using very complex and crazy sentences which seem quite
			unusual for normal life. These sorts of experiments always remind me
			of <a href="https://youtu.be/CiRu_W9tzM8?t=42">Bilbo Baggins's birthday
			speech</a> with the ridiculously complicated sets of embdeeded quantifiers
			("<em>I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like
			less than half of you half as well as you deserve!</em>"). We can't be
			sure that the way people understand these crazy sentences is a good
			reflection of the way they understand normal language. In our next
			case study below, we'll briefly see how we can use <a href="../../CBS592/">psycholinguistic
			techniques</a> to measure how people process more normal, natural
			utterances.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Case study 2: is there a processing cost for implicatures?</h3>
		<p class="centercol">Above, we learned about the debate over whether "scalar implicatures"
			are really implicatures. Another, quite separate, debate focuses on whether or
			not there is an extra cognitive processing cost to understand implicatures. 
			According to one view, understanding an implicature should take more time and
			more cognitive effort. Understanding the literal meaning of a sentence just
			takes semantics, but understanding an implicature takes extra steps of
			logical inference (recall that, as we saw in the module on <a href="../WeakStrong/">weak
			and strong implicatures</a>, recovering a strong scalar implicature is a supposedly
			a four-step inferential process) and each of these steps must take some time
			and effort. Therefore, some researchers argue that if scalar implicatures are
			processed according to Gricean pragmatic reasoning, it should take more time
			and effort to interpret "<em>some</em>" as meaning "not all" (i.e., to interpret
			it pragmatically) than it does to interpret "<em>some</em>" as meaning "at
			least one and possibly all" (i.e., to interpret it literally/semantically).</p>
		<p class="centercol">To test that, we need some way of measuring how long it takes
			someone to interpret some utterance, and/or how much effort they are using to
			understand the utterance. Fortunately, <a href="../../CBS592/">psycholinguistics</a>
			provides us with many tools for doing that. We can use special sorts of equipment
			to measure people's brain activity and/or eye movements while they're reading or
			hearing a sentence, or we can even use simple computer programs to time how long
			it takes them to read a sentence.</p>
		<p class="centercol"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063943">One
			of my own experiments</a> did just that. We had people read very short stories 
			like the ones below, and we used a computer to time how long it took them to
			read each phrase. (This experiment was inspired by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705001253">a
			very similar 2006 experiment by Breheny, Katsos, & Williams</a>. Their 2006 experiment
			was groundbreaking, in that it figured out this clever way to test how people
			read sentences with scalar implicatures, and it inspired a whole generation of
			follow-up research such as the one I'm describing below. But I'm using my own
			experiment as the example for this module because I think the sentences are
			a bit more straightforward; the Breheny et al. 2006 experiment is very similar
			but there is an extra difference between the key sentences which complicates the
			design.)</p>
		<ol class="center">
			<li><strong>Upper-bounded:</strong> Mary asked John whether he intended to host all
				of his relatives in his tiny apartment. John replied that he intended to host
				<u>some of</u> his relatives. The rest would stay in a nearby hotel.</li>
			<li><strong>Lower-bounded:</strong> Mary asked John whether he intended to host any
				of his relatives in his tiny apartment. John replied that he intended to host
				<u>some of</u> his relatives. The rest would stay in a nearby hotel.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="centercol">These two stories are almost completely identical, except for one
			word. In the "upper-bounded" context, Mary asks a question about whether John
			will host <em>all</em> of his relatives. In the "lower-bounded" context, on the other
			hand, Mary asks a question about whether John will host <em>any</em> of his
			relatives. This tiny difference should cause a difference in how the word "<em>some</em>"
			gets interpreted later. In the upper-bounded context, it is likely that readers
			would interpret John's response "<em>some</em>" as meaning that he will host
			"not all" of his relatives (since Mary directly asked a question about whether
			he'd host all of his relatives, and he didn't just say "yes"). On the other hand,
			in the lower-bounded context, it is likely that readers would not interpret
			"<em>some</em>" in that way, and they might think John is making no commitment
			about whether or not he would host all of them.</p>
		<p class="centercol">In other words, we expected that in the upper-bounded context
			readers would interpret "<em>some</em>" with an implicature, and in the lower-bounded
			context they would not (they would interpret it literally).</p>
		<p class="centercol">Having set up a way to get people to read the same sentence with
			or without an implicature (by reading the same sentence in different contexts),
			we could then measure how long they took to read each phrase in the sentence. The
			key phrase, underlined in the above examples, is "<em>some of</em>". As I mentioned
			above, some theories predict that it should take people extra time and effort
			to understand an implicature; if so, then people should need more time to read "<em>some of</em>"
			in the upper-bounded context than in the lower-bounded context.</p>
		<p class="centercol">You can see the key results from the experiment in the figure below.
			The graph shows the reading time for each phrase in the sentence; the reading times
			for the key phrase, "<em>some of</em>", are highlighted by a green circle. We can
			see that, contrary the prediction, people did not take more time to read this
			in the upper-bounded context than the lower-bounded context; if anything, they
			read slightly faster in the upper-bounded context.</p>
<center><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063943"><image width="40%" src="Politzer-AhlesFiorentino2013.png" alt="Figure from Politzer-Ahles & Fiorentino experiment; see main text for descrption."/></a></center>
		<p class="centercol">I actually found similar results as these in later studies measuring
			people's <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2015.1027235">brain
			waves</a> and <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/4/1/3/112949/Eye-Movement-Evidence-for-Context-Sensitive">eye
			movements</a> as they heard or read sentences like these. Across all these studies, 
			I never found evidence that people need extra time and effort to understand
			scalar implicatures. (But I may be in the minority here; most researchers writing
			about this topic seem to assume that it's now widely accepted that implicatures
			take time and effort. See Noveck, chapter 6, for a good and nuanced discussion
			of much of this research looked at together.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">One of the benefits of this type of research is that we don't
			have to explicitly ask people what they think a sentence means, and thus we
			don't have to worry about subjective responses or the possibility that people
			might not be able to accurately report what they think something means (or,
			even worse, that our very act of asking the question will influence how they
			interpret the sentence). We also don't need to present volunteers with crazy
			and complicated sentences. We can just give people relatively normal utterances,
			and have them listen to or read them in a relatively natural way. As long as
			we have a good experiment design, we can then use their objective behavioural
			or neural responses to make inferences about how pragmatics works. The drawback
			to all this is that experiments themselves involve a lot of assumptions and
			complicated methodology, and the link between the experiment and the
			phenomena we want to test may break down along any of these assumptions (i.e.,
			using the experiment results to make conclusions about how scalar implicatures
			work requires assuming that our experiment is accurately measuring how people
			process scalar implicatures, so if there's any reason to doubt that assumption
			then that will also cast doubt on anything we learn about pragmatics through
			that experiment).</p>



		<h3 class="centercol">In-class activities</h3>

		<div class="content">
		<p>Take any pragmatics question from earlier in this class (it could be something

		</center>


		



<!--		<p class="centercol">Another possibility, which is most similar to the above view and
			most compatible with the discussions of scalar implicature we've had in this class,
			is that scalar implicatures are still implicatures, but they are <em>particularized</em>
			conversational implicatures. In other words, they aren't special and they aren't
			realized through a special mechanism; rather, they are processed in the same way as
			any other Gricean implicature, and are subject to the same constraints and are
			affected by context in the same way.</p>
		<p class="centercol">On the other hand, there are several views in which scalar
			implicatures are not implicatures at all. One view, which has little support,
			is that these meanings are just part of the literal (semantic) meanings of
			these words; i.e., <em>smart</em> means "smart but not brilliant", <em>sometimes</em>
			means "sometimes but not all the time", etc. (or, more specifically, there
			are two similar homophones, which we could call <em>sometimes</em><sub>1</sub> and
			<em>sometimes</em><sub>2</sub>, such that <em>sometimes</em><sub>1</sub> means
			"at least some of the time" and <em>sometimes</em><sub>2</sub> means "some but
			not all of the time", and whenever we say <em>sometimes</em> the listener has
			to figure out which one we mean based on the context). There is little good evidence for
			this position and lots of strong evidence against it. But there are other
			non-implicature-based views which are more feasible. On one extreme there is
			Relevance Theory, and at the other extreme there is what is called the "grammatical"
			theory.
		<p class="centercol">Relevance Theory is considered a "post-Gricean" view, as it was initially motivated
			by Grice's ideas but has since evolved into something quite different from
			Gricean pragmatics and rejects many Gricean concepts. According to Relevance
			Theory, the meanings
			of most words are inherently vague and always get narrowed down in context, and
			this narrowing happens at the level of "what is said" (in Relevance Theory this
			is called "explicature"), so what we call "scalar implicatures" are actually
			just a normal part of figuring out what is said and thus are not implicatures.
			Figuring out that <em>sometimes</em> might mean "not all the time" in a certain
			context is no different than figuring out, e.g., that <em>tall</em> means
			something different if we're describing a tall kindergartener vs. a tall NBA
			player. For these reasons, Noveck & Sperber (2007) famously argued that
			scalar implicatures are neither scalar nor implicatures: they're not scalar
			because they don't depend on the existence of certain memorized lexical scales
			(they happen to all kinds of words&mdash;no matter whether or not they're
			part of a scale&mdash;and always depend on context), and they're not implicatures
			because they happen at the level of "what is said" (explicature) rather than
			the level of "what is meant".</p>
		<p class="centercol">On the other hand, the grammatical theory also claims that
			scalar implicatures are not implicatures, but for a very different reason.
			According to this theory, these words have their literal meaning (e.g.
			<em>sometimes</em> means "at least some of the time", <em>smart</em> means
			"at least smart", etc.), but their meaning gets enriched by a grammatical
			operator when they're used in a syntactic context. You can imagine this
			operator as being like a silent "<em>only</em>"; the idea is that when
			someone says "<em>Josh is smart</em>", there is actually a silent operator
			in the sentence that makes it be interpreted as "<em>Josh is ONLY smart</em>"
			(i.e., only smart but not brilliant). Likewise for any other "scalar" terms;
			for instance, an utterance like "<em>I sometimes remember to floss before
			brushing</em>" gets interpreted as "<em>I ONLY sometimes remember to floss
			before brushing</em>" because of the insertion of this silent operator.
			Crucially, according to the grammatical theory, this process happens in
			syntax and/or semantics, not in pragmatics, and thus "scalar implicatures"
			are not actually implicatures; they are grammatical (syntactic and/or
			semantic) enrichments.</p>
		<p class="centercol">One big point of contention between these theories has
			been the question of whether or not "scalar implicatures" occur in embedded
			contexts. All these theories agree that "scalar implicatures" can
			happen in matrix sentences; i.e., "<em>I regret some of the things I
			said</em>" may be taken to mean "I regret some, but not all, of the
			things I said". Where the theories disagree is on whether that "<em>some</em>"
			will still get interpreted as "not all" if it's in a syntactically embedded clause
			(e.g., "<em>I think the president regrets some of the things
			he said</em>"&mdash;according to the grammatical theory, this should mean not
			just that the speaker doesn't think the president regrets all the things he
			said, but furthermore that the speaker <em>does</em> think the president </em>does
			not</em> regret all the things he said), or in the scope of another semantic
			operator (e.g., "<em>All of the people involved in the scandal regret some
			of the things they said.</em>"&mdash;according to the grammatical theory this
			should mean that no person involved regrets everything they said, i.e., maybe
			person A regrets 80% of what he said and person B regrets 50% of what she said,
			but there is no person who regrets 100% of what he said.) Some of the pragmatic
			theories, on the other hand, might not
			predict "<em>some</em>" to get interpreted as "not all" in these situations,
			because implicatures 	are supposed to happen at the level of the full utterance
			rather than the level of a particular clause within the utterance (see, however,
			Geurts, chapters 7-8, for an explanation of how these theories can accommodate
			so-called "embedded implicatures" if those sorts of implicatures do indeed
			occur). Whether or not these utterances really do get interpreted this way is
			a topic of substantial debate, which we'll talk about more in the next module.</p>-->
