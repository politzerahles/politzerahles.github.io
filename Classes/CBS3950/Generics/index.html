		<h2>Generics</h2>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="../index.html">&#x21B5; Back to class homepage</a></p>


		<p class="centercol">Figuring out the truth-conditions for statements about specific
			people or things is relatively simple. (<em>Relatively</em>... if you take a
			class on semantics you will learn lots more complications I'm ignoring here.)
			For example, <em>Haile is a doctor</em> is true if and only if the person
			named Haile in the relevant discourse context is a doctor. (As we saw in
			<a href="../Presupposition/">the previous module</a>, there are also presuppositions
			associated with this sentence, e.g. the presupposition that there <em>is</em>
			someone named Haile, and that there is only one person named Haile in the
			context of our conversation. But it's not clear that those are part of the
			truth-conditions of this utterance.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">But what about a statement like "<em>Boys are good at
			STEM</em>"? What conditions are necessary for this statement to be true?
			Is it true if only three boys in the whole world are good at STEM? Is it
			only true if every boy in the world is good at STEM? Or what?</p>
		<p class="centercol">Statements like these are called <em>generic statements</em>,
			or <em>generics</em> for short. Rather than stating something about a
			specific entity (a person, thing, etc.), they instead describe a generalization
			about some whole category of entities. And it's not actually clear what
			these statements <em>mean</em>. We know this both from anecdotal experience
			(there are many real-world examples of different people interpreting a
			generic statement in different ways), and from controlled experiments,
			such as one by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01126.x">Cimpian
			and colleagues (2010)</a>, the paper from which most of the information and
			concepts in this module come from.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">An example of a generic statement interpreted in different ways</h3>
		<p class="centercol">We can find a nice example of this in <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=478">a
			discussion of putative Eastern/Western cultural differences</a> on <em>Language Log</em>.
			The article which this blog post is critiquing contains a generic statement,
			"<em>Americans usually see individuals; Chinese and other Asians see contexts.</em>"</p>
		<p class="centercol">The statement "<em>Americans usually see individuals</em>" is extra-complicated
			here because the word <em>usually</em> makes it ambiguous: does it mean that
			<em>each</em> American usually [but not always] sees individuals, or does it
			mean that <em>most</em> [but not all] Americans see individuals? The "not all"
			and "not always" bits are themselves quantity implicatures, not necessarily 
			part of the literal meaning of the statement. The "each" and "most" bits are
			the parts that are related to the generic statement. But since this statement
			is complicated by the ambiguity, let's instead focus on the second statement,
			"<em>Chinese people see contexts</em>". (Note that I have paraphrased this a
			bit from the original, but I think this is justifiable; "<em>Chinese and other
			Asians see contexts</em>" semantically entails "<em>Chinese see contexts</em>",
			and it's clear that <em>Chinese</em> here means Chinese people.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">In the context of this discussion, "seeing context" is a certain
			way of behaving in a particular sort of psychology experiment. In the experiments
			that the writer of this statement is describing (and that the rest of the blog
			post is criticizing), people see a video of fish swimming around in a tank, where
			one fish is more salient (bigger, or a different color, or whatever) than the
			others, and the person watching the video is asked to describe the scene. Some people describe
			what the salient fish is doing; other people describe other aspects of the video,
			like the background or this other fish. This latter group of people are the ones
			who supposedly "see context", according to this experiment.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The big question for us, though, is: what does "<em>Chinese
			people see context</em>" mean? Does it mean all Chinese people see context?
			Most Chinese people see context? Chinese people see context more than
			some other group of people does? Seeing context is an important and defining
			feature of being a Chinese person? Or what?</p>
		<p class="centercol">It is on the basis of statements like this that people make
			further generalizations like "Westerners are individualist and Asians are
			collectivist" (or "Western <em>societies</em> are individualist and Asian
			<em>societies</em> are collectivist"). It is certainly questionable whether
			the results of that fish-describing experiment license these more general
			conclusions (let's not mince words, it's more than just "questionable"; it's 
			obviously false). But that's not the relevant point here. The important
			point here is, those generic statements raise the same kinds of questions:
			does "<em>Westerners are individualist</em>" mean all of them are, most
			of them are, or what?</p>
		<p class="centercol">Further down in the comments on this same blog post, the
			author of the blog post writes, "<em>The question is whether it's in some
			sense scientifically established that <strong>all</strong> Asians are
			collectivist and <strong>all</strong> Westerners are individualist</em>"
			(my emphasis added). But <em>is</em> that the question? If you ask this
			question (and if you go on to say, e.g., "I have proved that it's not
			true that 'Asians are collectivist', because here I found an example of
			an Asian who is not collectivist"), you are interpreting the generic
			statement "<em>Asians are collectivist</em>" as meaning "<strong>All</strong>
			Asians are collectivist</em>.</p>
		<p class="centercol">We can find many examples, though, of generic statements
			that people consider "true" even though a corresponding "<em>all</em>"
			statement is certainly not true. For example: "<em>Ducks lay eggs</em>".
			People widely consider this to be true. But it certainly is not the case
			that <em>all</em> ducks lay eggs. Male ducks don't lay eggs; baby ducks
			don't lay eggs; ducks that are too sick, old, or injured to lay eggs
			don't lay eggs. So, most ducks <em>don't</em> lay eggs. Similarly,
			Cimpian and colleagues point out that people usually judge the sentence
			"<em>Mosquitos carry the West Nile virus</em>" as true, even though only
			about 1% of mosquitos actually carry it.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The same applies for the present example. It is likely
			that many people would judge sentences like "<em>Chinese people see
			context</em>" or "<em>Asians are collectivist</em>" as true, even
			based on just a few supporting examples. But on the other hand,
			people might then take those same sentences to mean that <em>all</em>
			Chinese people see context or that <em>all</em> Asians are collectivist.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">The "asymmetry" of generics</h3>
		<p class="centercol">This example demonstrates a common "asymmetry" in how
			generics are interpreted: we don't need much evidence to accept a
			generic as true, but when we have to actually interpret it we think
			it refers to nearly all of the things in the category. Hence the title
			of Cimpian and colleagues' paper:
			"Generic statements require little evidence for acceptance but have
			powerful implications".</p>
		<p class="centercol">In their research, they gave people generic
			statements about made-up things, like "<em>Lorches have purple
			feathers</em>" (there's no such thing as a lorch!). Along with those
			statements, they provided statistical information, such as "30%
			of lorches have purple feathers", and then asked them if the generic
			statement ("<em>Lorches have purple feathers</em>") was true. They
			found that people tend to accept these statements as true even
			when the actual percentage of lorches with purple feathers is not
			very high, e.g. around 50%. (And people were even more willing to
			accept these if the feature being described is dangerous, distinctive,
			or otherwise striking and attention-grabbing; recall that, as we
			saw above, people believe "<em>Mosquitos carry West Nile virus</em>"
			is true even though only 1% of mosquitos do!) Thus the first half
			of this asymmetry: "generic statements require little evidence
			for acceptance". We are often willing to accept a generic statement
			(like "Boys are good at STEM", "Asians are collectivist", or "Lorches
			have purple feathers") based on only a few examples.</p>
		<p class="centercol">In this same experiment, the researchers also had
			people interpret what they think the generic sentence means&mdash;i.e.,
			they asked, "What percentage of lorches do you think have purple
			feathers?" People reliably estimated a much higher percentage than
			what they needed to accept the statement as true. For example,
			people might accept the statement "<em>Lorches have purple feathers</em>"
			as true when just 70% of lorches have purple feathers; but if you tell
			people "<em>Lorches have purple feathers</em>" and then ask them
			what percentage of lorches they think have purple feathers, they will
			guess that 95% do! Thus the second half of this asymmetry: "generic
			statements have powerful implications". When we hear a generic
			statement like "Boys are good at STEM", "Asians are collectivist",
			or "Lorches have purple feathers", we often interpret it as saying
			something about <em>almost all</em> boys/Asians/lorches.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Real-world disagreements over generic statements</h3>
		<p class="centercol">These properties of generic statements make them a
			common source of controversy, especially in political discourse.
			They can be used to suggest very broad generalizations, but they
			don't require very much evidence, and thus they can be pretty easily
			defended if someone criticizes them. Like we saw in our initial
			example above: if someone interprets "<em>Asians are collectivist</em>"
			as meaning that all Asians are collectivist and then brings up some
			compelling evidence that <em>not</em> all Asians are collectivist,
			someone else could respond by saying "Well, I never said that <em>all</em>
			of them are!"</p>
		<p class="centercol">For example, in debates over responses to the COVID-19
			pandemic, we have all heard many statements along the lines of
			"Travel restrictions are an effective way to stop the spread of
			the virus" or "Vaccines work!" Generic statements like these are
			difficult to argue against because the meaning of generics is
			fuzzy. (I am not raising this example to suggest that vaccines are
			bad&mdash;I myself am vaccinated and I encourage everyone to get
			vaccinated if they are able&mdash;but merely to point out that
			generic statements come from everywhere on the political
			spectrum and not just from the people we think are manipulative
			bad actors. It's easy to use pragmatics concepts to criticize
			the language of people we don't like or don't agree with, but
			it's important to apply the same scrutiny to our own "team" as
			well.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">For another example, let's consider one of the 
			first and most-remembered of many controversies in Donald Trump's
			2015-2016 United States presidential campaign. Describing people
			who immigrate from Mexico to the US (it's not clear to me if he
			was talking about all Mexican immigrants or just undocumented
			Mexican immigrants), Trump said, "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/"><em>They're
			bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some,
			I assume, are good people.</em></a>" These remarks were widely
			criticized, as they should be, but also prompted widespread
			debate over what they actually meant. Many people incorrectly
			claimed that Trump said all undocumented Mexican immigrants
			(or even "<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/08/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-falsely-says-trump-said-all-mexicans-are/">all
			Mexicans</a>") are rapists. But he didn't actually say that;
			he said a generic statement. Thus, in response to those
			criticisms, Trump supporters often replied, "He didn't say
			they <em>all</em> are!". And in fact they were right; the
			last little bit of the quote makes that explicit (as long
			as we adopt the extra assumption that "good people" are
			not rapists; this seems like a very reasonable assumption to me).
			My point here is not that what Trump said was good; it certainly
			was not, for other reasons (e.g., due to the Gricean principle
			of relevance, the fact that these characteristics are the ones
			he thought important to highlight certainly says something, and
			there is no doubt that these and similar remarks incited lots
			of anti-Latinx and anti-immigrant sentiment and hate crimes
			throughout the country). My point, rather, is that many
			of the arguments about generic statements end up missing
			these other points, because people interpret these statements
			in different ways and end up talking around one another.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The ability to make a strong statement
			while leaving yourself some wiggle room and ability to back
			out of that statement is one of the things that makes
			generic statements so powerful (and so dangerous). In fact,
			this characteristic is not unique to generic statements; as
			we will see in the "<a href="../Benefits/">Benefits of indirect
			utterances</a>" module near the end of class, this ability is
			one of the main reasons language has pragmatics at all.</p>

		<button class="collapsible">Generics and "striking" features</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>As we noted above, people are even more willing to accept a
				generic statement as true with little evidence if the statement
				is about a feature that is dangerous, distinctive, or "striking".
				In other words, people might normally accept "<em>Morseths have silver
				fur</em>" (this is another example from Cimpian et al., 2010)
				as true if actually 70% of morseths have silver fur; but if they are
				first told that morseth's silver fur is dangerous because it sheds
				air particles that can cause breathing difficulty, then they might
				accept "<em>Morseths have silver fur</em>" as true even if just 30%
				or even just 10% of morseths have silver fur! <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01971/full">Lazaridou-Chatzigoga
				and colleagues (2019)</a> further showed that even young children
				show this bias: children are more likely to make generalizations
				based on generic statements about "striking" features than on
				generic statements about "neutral" features.</p>
			<p>Why do you think this happens? What communicative purpose do you think
				it serves? And how could this make generic statements extra dangerous
				(or, at least, extra prone to misinterpretation)?</p>
