		<h2>Types of implicatures and their diagnostics</h2>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="../index.html">&#x21B5; Back to class homepage</a></p>


		<p class="centercol">Grice distinguished a few types of implicatures. Most of these categories are problematic,
			and the distinctions between them remain controversial, but it's still useful to review them to
			become aware of relevant pragmatic issues (are you noticing a theme yet in this class?). Also,
			these terms and concepts are still commonly used, so you need to know what they are if you want
			to understand people talking about pragmatics.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Let's look at a few different examples:</p>
		<ol class="center">
			<li><em><a href="c'est anglais mais c'est bon.jpg">C'est anglais, mais c'est bon !</a></em> ("They're English, but they're good!")</li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><strong>suggests</strong>: English stuff is usually not good</li></ul>
			<li><em>Sammy and Chris fell in love and got married.</em></li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><strong>suggests</strong>: First they fell in love, then they got married</li></ul>
			<li><em>Did you win the lottery and not tell me?</em> (uttered in the <em>Breaking Bad</em> scene we discussed in <a href="../CooperativePrinciple/">the previous module</a>)</li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><strong>suggests</strong>: We don't have enough money for the house you want</li></ul>
		</ol>
		<p class="centercol">When (1) suggests that English stuff is usually not good, that's
			an example of what Grice calls <em>conventional implicature</em>. On the other hand,
			the things suggested by (2)
			and (3) are both examples of what Grice calls <em>conversational implicature</em>, but they're
			different types. The suggestion in (2), that Sammy and Chris fell in love first and
			got married second, is what Grice calls a <em>generalized conversational implicature</em>.
			On the other hand, the suggestion in (3), that Walt and Skyler don't have enough money
			for a fancy house, is what Grice calls a <em>particularized conversational implicature</em>.
			Let's break down what these distinctions mean.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Conventional implicatures</h3>
		<p class="centercol">These are implicatures which, according to Grice, don't come from context
			or even from reasoning about speaker's beliefs and intentions, but come from the way
			language is conventionally used. e.g., as speakers of English we know that "but" is
			used in a way that implies some sort of contrast, even though it doesn't literally mean
			that.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Many conventional implicatures feel, at first blush, like regular old
			literal meaning. For example, one of Grice's examples is "<em>The queen is English and
			therefore brave</em>"; he argues that this utterance implies, but doesn't literally
			say, that the quality of brave-ness follows from the quality of English-ness, i.e.,
			all English people are brave. Intuitively, it seems like the second part (i.e. the idea
			that all English people are brave) just comes from the literal "meaning"
			of <em>therefore</em>. Nevertheless, many pragmaticists argue that, even though
			these implicatures come from the conventional usages of certain words (like <em>but</em> and
			<em>therefore</em>), the implicatures themselves are things that are only suggested
			by the utterance, rather than explicitly said; at the end of this module we will
			review some evidence for this. Anyway, 
			the conventional implicature associated with "<em>but</em>" seems to be the one that
			holds up the best, and thus whenever people talk about conventional implicatures they
			almost always use this example. Another pretty good example is "<em>even</em>"; if
			I say "<em>Even John likes this pizza</em>", it seems to imply (without literally
			saying) that John is someone who is picky or who normally doesn't like pizza.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Of all the types of implicatures, this is the trickiest category, because
			it doesn't differ obviously from semantic meaning in the way the other sorts of implicature
			do. Some people who study pragmatics and semantics doubt the
			distinction between "conventional implicature" and truth-conditional meaning at all.
			Some also say Grice shouldn't have called them "conventional implicatures" at all,
			because even if they are different
			from semantic, truth-conditional meaning, they don't really seem like "implicatures",
			in that they don't require reasoning about speakers' intentions and the Cooperative
			Principle. Grice calls them implicatures anyway, though, because they are not part
			of the semantic (truth-conditional) meaning; for Grice, meaning is divided into
			"what is said" (which comes from semantics and is truth-conditional) and everything
			else&mdash;everything that doesn't come from semantics and is not truth-conditional
			is an "implicature".</p>
		<p class="centercol">No matter what conventional implicatures are, they do seem to raise a
			challenge to the idea of a clear-cut distinction between semantics and pragmatics,
			as they sort of seem to have some properties of each (although see Zufferey et al.,
			chapter 5, for an explanation of how this conundrum can be solved while maintaining
			a semantics-pragmatics distinction). But, as mentioned above (and as we will see
			more concretely below), conventional implicatures are different
			from semantic meaning&mdash;and similar to pragmatic meaning and implicatures&mdash;in
			a very important way: they aren't truth-conditional. This is the main reason that
			traditional pragmaticists group conventional implicatures together with conversational
			implicatures (i.e., as part of pragmatics) rather than together with semantic meaning
			(see e.g. <a href="https://brill.com/view/title/23280">Feng, 2010</a>, chapter 2, for
			more discussion of this point).</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Conversational implicatures</h3>
		<p class="centercol">Conversational implicatures are the "real" implicatures, which
			come from reasoning about what a speaker must have intended. Most of the examples
			we've seen, and most of the rest of this class, will be focused on conversational
			implicatures.</p>
		<p class="centercol">As we saw above, though, these can be divided into "generalized"
			and "particularized" conversational implicatures. Grice himself didn't make
			a big deal of this distinction (he pretty much just mentioned it in passing and
			then didn't talk about it again), but many pragmatics scholars since then have
			been crazy about it.</p>
		<p class="centercol">"Generalized" conversational implicatures are ones that don't
			depend on context; uttering certain things will (supposedly) always trigger
			these implicatures. Looking at the example (2) above, it seems reasonable
			to assume that "X happened and Y happened" always implies "X happened before
			Y", regardless of the context in which it is uttered.</p>
		<p class="centercol">You might notice now
			that generalized conversational implicatures sound similar to conventional
			implicatures&mdash;both seem intimately connected to certain words or
			phrases, and neither depends on the context. I've mixed these up myself
			before. Towards the end of this module we'll look at how they are
			different and why this difference is important.</p>
		<p class="centercol">"Particularized" conversational implicatures are much more
			straightforward. They depend on the context and on reasoning about the
			speaker, so they only arise in certain contexts. Consider example (3)
			above. "<em>Did you win the lottery and not tell me?</em>" implies "We don't
			have enough money for the house you want" in the context of this particular
			conversation, but in another context it would not imply that (hence why I
			had to specify the context when I shared the example).</p>
		<p class="centercol">Many pragmaticists, from a variety of theoretical perspectives,
			reject the division between "generalized" and "particularized" conversational
			implicatures, and instead argue that all conversational implicatures are
			"particularized" and are derived via the same mechanisms (see, e.g.,
			<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-818X.2010.00203.x">Katsos
			& Cummins, 2010</a>, for review). For our purposes in this class, however, there
			is one practical way this distinction will be useful: for clarifying the
			difference between conventional and conversational implicatures. If we
			compare a conventional implicature like (1) to a particularized conversational
			implicature like (3), the difference is so obvious that we don't really need
			any special ways to notice the difference. But comparing (1) and (2) is
			much trickier; how can we figure out that (1) is a "conventional implicature"
			and (2) is a "conversational implicature"? The difference here is not so
			intuitive, so we will need some special techniques to recognize the difference.
			Let's turn to those now.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Diagnostics for implicatures</h3>
		<p class="centercol">A "diagnostic" is a straightforward test for something (e.g.,
			if you think you have the flu, you go to a doctor and they administer some
			kind of test which will tell you whether or not you have the flu). Pragmaticists
			have thought of some good diagnostics for recognizing different kinds of
			implicatures.</p>

		<h4 class="centercol">Distinguishing conversational implicatures from conventional
			implicatures and truth-conditional meaning: cancellability</h4>
		<p class="centercol">The most important and most useful
			diagnostic is <em>cancellability</em>: testing whether an implicature could
			be cancelled (or prevented from arising in the first place). A
			conversational implicature can be cancelled without contradicting oneself.
			For example, we can explicitly say that the implicature in (2) is false, but
			our utterance won't sound weird or self-contradictory: "<em>Sammy and Chris
			fell in love and got married. <strong>But not in that order!</strong></em>" Likewise for the
			one in (3): "<em>Did you win the lottery and not tell me? I'm not suggesting
			that we don't have enough money; I'm just literally asking because I found
			this lottery card.</em>" Maybe these might sound a bit funny, but they
			certainly sound more acceptable than what happens if we try to cancel an
			utterance's literal, truth-conditional meaning; for example, "<em>Sammy
			and Chris fell in love and got married, but they didn't get married</em>"
			is self-contradictory and paradoxical.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Importantly, only <em>conversational</em> implicatures are
			cancellable. Conventional implicatures are not. Let's look again at example
			(1), where a box of British cookies (McVitie's) being sold in France had a
			label on them that says, "They're English, but they're good!" This conventionally
			implies that English food is not usually good (and this is why people find
			this box of cookies hilarious). Trying to cancel this conventional implicature
			sounds pretty weird: "They're English, but they're good&mdash;I'm not trying
			to suggest that English stuff is usually bad, though." To me, this sounds
			much worse than the cases where we cancelled conversational implicatures;
			it sounds more like the case where we cancelled literal meaning.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Something very related to the cancellability test is to
			try uttering something in a situation where its implicature is not true.
			For example, if the reality is that Sammy and Chris got married first and
			then later fell in love (maybe they had an arranged marriage, or a green-card
			marriage, or something like that?), and you say "<em>Sammy and Chris fell in
			love and got married</em>", I feel like this sounds <em>misleading</em>, but not
			necessarily <em>false</em>. This is because, again, the conversational implicature
			of this utterance (the suggestion that they fell in love first and got married
			second) is not part of its literal, truth-conditional meaning. On the other
			hand, if Sammy and Chris haven't gotten married at all, then uttering
			"<em>Sammy and Chris fell in love and got married</em>" would be downright false,
			not just misleading.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Here again we can contrast conventional implicatures with
			conversational implicatures. How does it sound if I say "<em>They're English,
			but they're good</em>" in a situation where English food really is good?
			Perhaps this is hard to imagine, since English food is famously terrible
			and even English people think so. Maybe we can use a more realistic example:
			for instance, Chongqing food is famous for being spicy, so how would it
			sound if I said "<em>This hotpot is Chongqing style, but it's spicy!</em>"
			Here I have just uttered a sentence in a situation where its conventional
			implicature (the suggestion that Chongqing food is not normally spicy) is
			obviously false. To me, this sentence sounds very wrong... not just misleading,
			but infelicitous and somehow ill-formed. Perhaps it's not as obviously bad
			as "<em>Sammy and Chris fell in love and got married</em>" when they haven't
			gotten married, but it's certainly far worse&mdash;and worse in a different
			way&mdash;than "<em>Sammy and Chris fell in love and got married</em>" when
			they actually got married first and fell in love second. So here we see
			another example of how we can distinguish between conventional and
			conversational implicatures. Conversational implicatures are cancellable,
			and when an utterance's conversational implicature is false the utterance
			itself is still true and well-formed; conventional implicatures
			have neither of those features.</p>
		<p class="centercol">(The cancellability test is not without problems.
			Levinson (chapter 3.2.1) goes into some detail on problems with cancellability
			and other diagnostics. But for our purposes in this class, the cancellability
			test is a good start.)</p>
		
		<h4 class="centercol">Distinguishing conventional implicatures from truth-conditional
			meaning</h4>
		<p class="centercol">Cancellability can help us tell the difference betwen
			conversational and conventional implicatures, but how can we tell the
			difference between conventional implicatures and literal, truth-conditional
			meaning?</p>
		<p class="centercol">One difference between them is intuitive: in the examples
			we saw related to cancellability above, there do seem to be subtle
			differences between conventional implicatures and literal meaning.
			Saying something when its literal meaning is false makes a sentence
			completely false, whereas saying something when its conventional
			implicature is false makes a sentence weird, infelicitous, or somehow
			ill-formed. If you say something whose literal meaning is false, then
			people might correct you or say that you're wrong (e.g., if you point
			at a Korean dish and say "<em>This is Chongqing food but it's spicy!</em>", people
			might say, "It's not Chongqing food, it's Korean food!"). On the other hand,
			if you say something whose conventional implicature is false, then
			people are more likely to tell you that what you said doesn't make sense
			(if you point at some Chongqing hotpot and say "<em>This is Chongqing
			but it's spicy!</em>", people will be more likely to say, "Why did you
			say <em>but</em>? Chongqing food is always spicy!"). In other words,
			if you say something whose literal meaning is false, then people will
			object to <em>what</em> you said, but if you say something whose
			conventional implicature is false, then people will object to <em>the
			way you said it</em>. This is one of the key differences between conventional
			implicatures and literal meaning (although it seems pretty subjective).</p>
		<p class="centercol">This distinction also works for other conventional
			implicature examples we saw above. For example, if the queen really is
			British (this is certainly true) and really is brave (I don't know
			if this is true and in fact I suspect it is not [since the only appropriate
			and brave thing for a monarch to do in the 21st century is to abolish
			the monarchy, and she has not yet done that], but let's pretend
			for now that it is true), but it's not
			true that British people are necessarily brave, then "<em>The queen
			is British, and therefore she is brave</em>" sounds weird but not
			necessarily false. Likewise, saying
			"<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393213001905">Even
			Jeff Bezos can afford that house</a>" sounds wrong (because "even X
			can Y" implies that X is someone/something who would normally be
			unlikely to Y, whereas in reality we know that Jeff Bezos is an
			evil rich supervillian so it's not at all unlikely that he could
			afford some house), but doesn't sound false.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Utterances vs. meanings</h3>
		<p class="centercol">One final thing I must emphasize is that sentences
			or utterances themselves are not implicatures. An utterance has
			multiple meanings, and some of those meanings might be implicatures.
			For example, it makes no sense to say that example #1 from the beginning of this module <em>is</em>
			a conventional implicature or that example #2 <em>is</em> a
			generalized conventional implicature. Instead, example #1 is an
			utterance which means several things at once: it means that the
			cookies are English and they're good (its semantic meaning) and,
			at the same time, it also means that English cookies are usually
			bad (a conventional implicature). Likewise, example #2 is
			an utterance which means that Sammy and Chris fell in love (part
			of its literal meaning), Sammy and Chris got married (also part of
			its literal meaning), and might also mean that their falling
			in love happened first and their getting married happened second
			(a generalized conversational implicature). These meanings
			are all there at the same time. It doesn't make sense to
			try something like the cancellability test, or any other diagnostic,
			on a sentence or utterance; you try this test on <em>one of its
			meanings</em>, which means you need to clearly specify which meaning
			you are testing.</p> 
		<p class="centercol">To illustrate the importance of talking about
			meanings instead of sentences or utterances, and the fact that one
			utterance can have a bunch of meanings at the same time, let's
			wrap up by considering the two graphs below. First, here's a graph
			of the traditional Gricean way of dividing up the meaning of an
			utterance into its parts. Meaning is divided into semantic meaning
			("what is said") and implicatures (everything else). Implicatures
			can be further broken down into conventional and conversational
			implicatures, and conversational implicatures can be broken down
			into generalized and particularized conversational implicatures.</p>
<center><img src="Slide1.PNG" alt="" width=60% /></center>
		<p class="centercol">Now imagine that I went to see a movie with a few other
			people who both you and I are friends with, but you weren't able
			to come to the movie with us. Later you chat with me and ask me
			how the movie was. I say, "<em>Even John wanted to get up and leave!</em>"
			This utterance means several things at once; in fact, in this context,
			it has every kind of meaning from the chart above. As illustrated below,
			it literally just means that John wanted to get up and John wanted to
			leave. But also, given the context, it seems to suggest that the movie
			was bad, and this suggestion is a particularized conversational
			implicature&mdash;we can infer that the reason someone would want
			to get up and leave is because the movie was bad. Furthermore, because
			of the word <em>even</em>, it suggests that John is somehow the
			least likely person to want to get up and leave from a movie (maybe
			he's a big fan of this type of movie, or maybe he's just very polite
			and thinks it's rude to leave during a movie); this is a conventional
			implicature. And "<em>get up and leave</em>" might implicate, through
			generalized conversational implicature, that he wants to get up
			first and leave second (although this part of the meaning doesn't
			seem very important for the overall interpretation of this particular utterance).
			The important thing to see here is that one utterance has all four
			types of meaning we've seen here, so you can't just say that
			this utterance "is" a conventional implicature or "is cancellable"
			or anything like that; you need to figure out which particular
			meaning within the utterance you want to analyze and then use
			the tests on that particular meaning to figure out which kind
			of meaning it is.</p>
<center><img src="Slide2.PNG" alt="" width=60% /></center>


		<h3 class="centercol">Summary</h3>
		<p class="centercol">The chart below summarizes the differences between
			the four kinds of meaning we have encountered so far: semantic
			meaning, plus the three kinds of implicatures discussed in this
			module.</p>
<center><img src="typesofimplicature.png" alt="" width=60% /></center>
		<p class="centercol">As we can see here, what separates semantic meaning
			from all kinds of implicatures is that semantic meaning is truth-conditional
			and implicatures are not&mdash;in other words, saying something when
			its semantic meaning is false makes the utterance false, whereas saying
			something when its implicature is false makes the utterance weird or
			misleading but not false.</p>
		<p class="centercol">What separates semantic meaning and conventional
			implicatures from conversational implicatures is that the first two
			are not cancellable, whereas conversational implicatures are. If I
			say something that has a conversational implicature and then we immediately
			deny that implicature (e.g., "<em>Sammy and Chris got fell in love and
			got married... but not in that order</em>"), it doesn't sound like
			I have contradicted myself, it just sounds like I have offered a
			clarification; on the other hand, if I deny the semantic meaning
			or conventional implicature of what I said (e.g., "<em>That's a red apple...
			but it's not an apple</em>" or "<em>Hanako is Japanese and therefore
			he loves anime... but liking anime doesn't necessarily follow from being
			Japanese</em>") then it sounds like I have contradicted myself.</p>
		<p class="centercol">And
			what separates <em>particularized</em> conversational implicatures
			from the other three types of meaning is that particularized
			conversational implicatures depend on the context, whereas the
			other types of meaning do not. "<em>Apple</em>" means apple no
			matter what context, and "<em>but</em>" has a conventional
			implicature no matter what context, but "<em>Did you win the
			lottery and not tell me?</em>" only means "we don't have
			enough money for the kind of house you want" in a particular
			kind of context.</p>

		<button class="collapsible">Classifying some meanings</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Here are a few sentences:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hobbes, a tiger, loves tuna fish sandwiches.</li>
				<li>Hobbes (a tiger) loves tuna fish sandwiches.</li>
				<li>Hobbes, who is a tiger, loves tuna fish sandwiches.</li>
				<li>Hobbes is a tiger, and he loves tuna fish sandwiches.</li>
				<li>Hobbes is a tiger who loves tuna fish sandwiches.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of these sentences say (literally, truth-conditionally) that Hobbes loves
				tuna fish sandwiches. They also convey that Hobbes is a tiger.</p>
			<p>What kind of information is this second bit (the fact that Hobbes is a tiger)?
				A truth-conditional entailment, a conventional implicature, or a
				conversational implicature?</p>
			<p>Have students discuss this and justify their conclusions.</p>
			<p>(Hints: in the first three examples, the claim that Hobbes is a tiger is within
				an <em>appositive</em>, and traditionally these have been thought to
				contribute to conventional implicatures rather than truth conditions
				[see, e.g., <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199273829.001.0001/acprof-9780199273829">Potts, 2005</a>]. But there has been a lot of debate over this,
				and some authors [e.g. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jos/article-abstract/32/3/525/1640703">Syrett & Koev, 2014</a>] have claimed that they are
				truth-conditional. See <a href="https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/SALT/article/view/29.180">Kroll & Rysling, 2019</a>, for a review.
				You don't need to present all this information to the class, and they don't need to know this information in order to do the discussion; this
				is just background information for you. Anyway,
				if appositives contribute to conventional implicatures rather than
				to truth-conditions, then the first three constructions here should
				feel "less false" than the other two constructions if Hobbes really
				isn't a tiger [you can test this by replacing this with a sentence
				where the information in the appositive really is false, such as
				"<em>Guangzhou, a city in the north of China, is my hometown</em>".)</p>

			<p>If they figure out those easily, here's some more they can try. The following
				three sentences each convey that not all of my cats have stripes. Again, have
				students figure out how that information is conveyed in each utterance (i.e.,
				is it part of the literal meaning, a conventional implicature, a generalized
				conversational implicature, a particularized conversational implicature, or
				none of the above?).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Some of my cats have stripes.</li>
				<li>Only some of my cats have stripes.</li>
				<li><em><strong>SOME</strong></em> of my cats have stripes!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">The reinforcability test</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Levinson (chapter 3.2) discusses another diagnostic for conversational
				implicatures, called <em>reinforceability</em>. The idea is that
				when we say something that makes a conversational implicature, we
				can further add something which emphasizes (reinforces) the implicature
				and it won't sound weird or redundant. On the other hand, other kinds
				of meaning supposedly don't allow this. Compare example (1) below,
				where the underlined portion reinforces the implicature (the interpretation
				of <em>some</em> as meaning "not all"), versus example (2), where the
				underlined portion reinforces the literal meaning (the interpretation of
				<em>some</em> as meaning "more than zero"); (1) sounds acceptable and
				(2) does not:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Some of the boys went to the soccer match, <u>but not all</u>.</em></li>
				<li><em>Some of the boys went to the soccer match, <u>but not none</u>.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Have students discuss the reinforcability test. Is it useful for distinguishing
				between conversational implicatures and other types of meaning? Are there other,
				better ways to explain the contrast between (1) and (2) above? Are conversational
				implicatures always reinforceable, and are other meanings always not
				reinforceable?</p>
			<p>A few points of my own I've noticed, which may or may not come up during
				the discussion:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The difference between (1) and (2) seems to be related to the conventional
					implicature associated with <em>but</em>, rather than reinforceability
					per se. As we have seen, <em>but</em> implies a contrast. In (1) it's
					normal that there is a contrast between the first conjunct (which is
					about people going to the match) and the second conjunct (which is
					about people <em>not</em> going to the match). In (2) there does not
					seem to be any such contrast. So this example doesn't really show
					reinforceability. We could eliminate this confound by replacing <em>but</em>
					with <em>and</em>; if we do that, then (2) seems somewhat acceptable to
					me. Or we could try this test with some different conversational
					implicatures.</li>
				<li>Reinforceability sometimes seems possible with other meanings as
					well:</li>
					<ul>
					<li><em>Presuppositions</em>. We will learn about these in
						<a href="../Presupposition/">a later module</a>. For now, all
						you need to know is that, for example, a sentence like
						"<em>My girlfriend will come to the party</em>" <em>presupposes</em>
						(but doesn't literally <em>say</em>) that I have a girlfriend.
						Most theories say this is a different kind of meaning than
						conversational implicatures. However, it seems acceptable
						to reinforce these, e.g. in the context of rubbing a fact
						in someone's face or bragging about something; e.g., "<em>My
						girlfriend will come to the party. Yeah, that's right, I have
						a girlfriend!</em>" A real example: in one episode of the TV
						show <em>Scrubs</em>, one character <a href="https://scrubs.fandom.com/wiki/My_Hero_transcript">tells</a>
						another, "Please don't tell me that you've come here to reiterate
						things to me that I've already said, because I know the things
						I've already said. In fact, <em>I'm the one who said them!</em>"
						Here, "<em>I know the things I've already said</em>" seems to
						presuppose that the speaker said things (and thus that he's the
						one who said those things), and the next sentence seems to
						reinforce that.</li>
					<li><em>Entailments</em>. It seems possible to emphasize or
						reinforce an entailment, particularly when explaining
						something that a listener has missed or might misunderstand.
						For example, if I say "<em>I have a black dog</em>", and then
						the conversation turns to discussing who has dogs,
						I might reinforce this by saying, "<em>I already said I
						have a black dog. So, of course I have a dog.</em>" This
						particular example might seem a bit simplistic, but this
						sort of stuff occurs in e.g. educational contexts (where
						someone might explain some concept to a student), or in
						things like mathematic proofs (where everything after
						some initial premise is entailed by one or more
						preceding premises, but nevertheless is explicitly
						said).</li>

			<p>Given examples like these, it seems like we need an explanation for just
				what sorts of things count for the "reinforceability" test. For example
				maybe we can explain away the presupposition examples by saying that
				the reinforcement here is unusual and marked, and the speaker is
				intentionally saying something unusual to emphasize a point (that is,
				indeed, one of the main uses of pragmatics), and the very fact that
				it is unusual and attention-grabbing is evidence that this sort
				of reinforcement is not normal. For the entailment example, we could
				explain it using mutual knowledge; implicatures arise from mutual
				knowledge (i.e. when both the speaker and hearer know something, and
				know that each other know it) and the hearer is able to use the Cooperative
				Principle and the mutual knowledge to reason about what the speaker
				must have meant; clearly for the examples I gave, something is not
				mutual knowledge (since it needed to be explained to the hearer), and
				that explains why it is not an implicature, although this still
				doesn't explain how the "reinforceability" test can be useful for
				distinguishing implicatures and non-implicatures.</p>

		<button class="collapsible">Separating conventional implicatures from truth-conditional meaning</button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>In the module we saw how conventional implicature is different from
			semantic (truth-conditional) meaning because conventional implicatures
			can't make an utterance false, just weird. We noted that this
			distinction is a bit subjective.</p>
		<p>Another diagnostic for conventional implicatures,
			which is a bit more complicated but might be a bit less subjective, is that a conventional implicature
			can be separated from truth-conditional meaning in a way that
			truth-conditional content itself cannot. As Geurts (chapter 1)
			points out, a sentence like "<em>That nurse is new but she's
			very skilled</em>" conventionally implies there is some contrast
			between being new and being skilled (i.e., people who are new to
			some profession are usually not skilled at that profession yet),
			but in a sentence like "<em>Half of the nurses here
			are new but skilled</em>", the implicature does not seem to be
			part of what "half of" is describing. In other words, this sentence
			seems to be saying that, out of all the nurses, half (but not all) of them
			are new-and-skilled; it does not seem to be saying that the
			contrast between being new and being skilled only exists for
			half of the nurses but not for all of them. We can see the same
			sort of separation with <em>therefore</em>. "<em>Half of the
			nurses are experienced and therefore skilled</em>" does not
			seem to suggest that the connection between being experienced
			and being skilled only exists for half of the nurses; rather,
			the idea seems to be that there is always a connection between
			being experienced and being skilled. (i.e., the sentence
			does not mean that half of the nurses are experienced-therefore-skilled
			while the other half of the nurses are skilled-in-spite-of-being-experienced!)</p>
		<p>The examples above are related to a kind of behaviour
			called "projection", where some part of meaning within one clause can
			apply outside of that clause. For example, consider a sentence like
			"<em>John thinks that's a black dog, but I don't</em>". This sentence has an
			embedded clause, "<em>that's a black dog</em>", and the literal semantic
			meaning of this clause says two things: (1) that's a dog, and (2)
			that's black. When I say "<em>I don't think that's a black dog</em>",
			the negative part ("<em>I don't think</em>") could be negating
			either part of that meaning in the embedded clause: maybe I don't
			think that's a black dog because I don't think it's black, or maybe
			I don't think it's a black dog because I don't think it's a dog.
			This is a property of how semantic meaning works.
			Conventional implicatures, on the other hand, don't work in
			this way. Think of a sentence with a conventional implicature
			in an embedded clause, like "<em>John thinks that nurse is new but skilled, but I don't</em>". The embedded clause ("<em>that nurse is
			new but skilled</em>") has three parts to its meaning: (1)
			that nurse is new, (2) that nurse is skilled, and (3) new nurses
			usually aren't skilled. (1) and (2) are part of the semantic
			meaning (entailments), and (3) is a conventional implicature.
			Importantly, only (1) or (2) are negated in this example.
			If I say "<em>I don't think that nurse is new but skilled</em>",
			I might have said that because I don't think the nurse is new
			(negating meaning #1) or because I don't think the nurse is
			skilled (negating meaning #2); but it doesn't seem natural
			for me to say "<em>I don't think that nurse is new but skilled</em>"
			to mean that I think the nurse is new and I think the nurse is
			skilled but I don't think there's a contrast between being new
			and being skilled. In other words, meaning #3, the conventional
			implicature, can't be cancelled by the negation. That is to say,
			conventional implicatures can be separated from semantic meaning,
			just as we saw in the examples in the previous paragraph.</p>
		<p>Here we've looked at this separation with <em>but</em> and
			<em>therefore</em>. Can you illustrate this distinction with other
			conventional implicature triggers, like <em>even</em>?</p>
