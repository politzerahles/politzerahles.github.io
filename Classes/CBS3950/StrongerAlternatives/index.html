		<h2>What's a stronger alternative?</h2>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="../index.html">&#x21B5; Back to class homepage</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">As we saw in the module on <a href="../WeakStrong/">weak and
			strong implicatures</a>, a certain kind of implicature (specifically,
			implicatures based on the maxim of quantity) is based on reasoning about
			"stronger alternatives" a person could have said. For example, "<em>Josh
			is smart</em>" may be taken to imply that Josh is not brilliant, because
			"<em>Josh is brilliant</em>" is a stronger alternative that the speaker
			could have said but chose not to say.</p>
		<p class="centercol">But what exactly counts as a "stronger alternative"?</p>
		<p class="centercol">In the abovementioned example, the "alternative" is
			an utterance we get by replacing one word. The only difference between
			"<em>Josh is smart</em>" and "<em>Josh is brilliant</em>" is a single
			word. So, the alternative is an utterance that's as similar as possible
			to the actual utterance, just with one word changed.</p>
		<p class="centercol">But alternatives don't have to be like that. An alternative
			could be much shorter than the actual utterance. For example, as we saw
			in <a href="../DisjunctionIgnorance/">the previous module</a>, "<em>There's
			a prize behind Door #1 or Door #2</em>" implies that the speaker does not
			know there's a prize behind Door #1. So in this case, the alternative
			(<em>There's a prize behind Door #1</em>) is shorter than the actual
			utterance (<em>There's a prize behind Door #1 or Door #2</em>).</p>
		<p class="centercol">An alternative can also be much longer than the actual
			utterance. For example, if you ask me what countries I have lived in,
			and I say "<em>I've lived in the USA and the UAE</em>", I imply that
			I haven't lived in any other countries. In this case, the alternatives
			that are ruled out by the quantity implicature are hundreds of
			possible utterances like "<em>I've lived in the USA, the UAE, and France</em>",
			"<em>I've lived in the USA, the UAE, and Ghana</em>", "<em>I've lived
			in the USA, the UAE, France, and Ghana</em>", and so on and so forth. (In
			fact, assuming there are 195 countries in the world, then the number of
			possible alternatives for this sentence is about ten octodecillion&mdash;that's
			a one with 58 zeroes after it.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">So it's not clear that we can systematically figure out
			what the possible alternatives are just by their surface similarity
			to the actual utterance. As we've seen above, alternatives can be
			shorter than, longer than, or about the same length as the actual
			utterance.</p>
		<p class="centercol">To have a more formal idea of what counts as a stronger
			alternative, we need to use the concept of <em>entailment</em>.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Entailment and alternatives</h3>
		<p class="centercol">We briefly discussed entailment at the end of the
			"<a href="../TruthConditions1/">Truth-conditional semantics</a>" module.
			Recall that one proposition entails another if the first proposition
			being true guarantees that the second is true. For example, "<em>That's
			a cat</em>" entails "<em>That's an animal</em>", because if the first
			one is true then the second one is definitely also true (because all
			cats are animals).</p>
		<p class="centercol">With the concept of entailment, we can formally define
			what makes an alternative "stronger". For some utterance A, B is a
			"stronger" (or "more informative") alternative if B entails A and
			A does not entail B. That probably sounds a little abstract, so let's
			apply it to the examples we saw above.</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>Scalar implicature (the speaker doesn't believe Josh is brilliant)</li>
				<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
					<li>Utterance: <em>Josh is smart.</em></li>
					<li>Alternative: <em>Josh is brilliant.</em></li>
				</ol>
			<li>Ignorance implicature (the speaker doesn't know there's a prize behind Door #1)</li>
				<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
					<li>Utterance: <em>There's a prize behind Door #1 or Door #2.</em></li>
					<li>Alternative: <em>There's a prize behind Door #1.</em></li>
				</ol>	
			<li>Ad-hoc implicature (the speaker hasn't lived in France)</li>
				<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
					<li>Utterance: <em>I've lived in the USA and the UAE</em></li>
					<li>Alternative: <em>I've lived in the USA, the UAE, and France</em></li>
				</ol>
		</ul>
		<p class="centercol">It should be clear that each of the B propositions
			above entails the corresponding A proposition, but not vice versa.
			If Josh is brilliant, it's guaranteed that he is smart (under the
			literal, logical interpretation of <em>smart</em> as meaning
			something like "at least smart, and maybe even brilliant"). But
			if Josh is smart, it's not guaranteed that he's brilliant (maybe
			he's just somewhat smart but not a super genius). Likewise, if
			it's true that there's a prize behind Door #1, then it's
			certainly true that "there's a prize	behind Door #1 or there's
			a prize behind Door #2". (This is the rule of logical disjunction,
			which you have probably learned about in math or philosophy
			classes before; logically, "<em>P or Q</em>" is true as long
			as either [or both] P is true or Q is true.) And if
			if it's true that I've lived in the USA, UAE, and France, then
			it's certainly true that I've lived in the USA and UAE; but if
			it's true that I've lived in the USA and UAE then there's no
			guarantee that I've also lived in France.</p>
		<p class="centercol">So on this basis we can formally identify what
			counts as a stronger (or more informative) alternative. Another
			way to think about this same concept is to think about what
			situations each proposition is true in. For example, the set of
			situations in which "<em>That's a cat</em>" is true is a smaller
			subset of [i.e., completely enclosed within] the set of situations
			in which "<em>That's an animal</em>" is true, as shown in the picture
			below:</p>
<center><a href="https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2018/10/25/hawaii-news/bill-seeks-to-address-issues-with-feral-cats-other-animals-at-county-transfer-stations/"><img src="catsanimals.png" alt="A picture of several cats, bigs, and birds. A circle labelled \"cats\" is drawn around just the cats, and a larger circle labelled \"animals\" is drawn around the whole picture." /></a></center>
		<p class="centercol">Something that's true in a smaller set of situations
			is stronger (more informative) than something that's true in a
			bigger set of situations, because it provides the hearer with
			a more specific view of what's going on.</p>
		<p class="centercol">(This is in fact the same thing as entailment,
			it's just another way to understand the same concept.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">This conception also helps explain why implicatures
			very similar to the examples above do not arise in certain
			contexts, such as downward-entailing environments. (A detailed
			explanation of downward entailment is something you'll find in
			a semantics class, but here's a quick one: an upward-entailing
			environment is one where specific subsets entail more general
			sets, and a downward-entailing environment is one where general
			sets entail specific subsets. For instance, "<em>That's a cat</em>"
			entails "<em>That's an animal</em>" [upward entailment]; but
			"<em>That's not an animal</em>" entails "<em>That's not a cat</em>"
			[downward entailment]). Compare the two examples below:</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>Upward-entailing environment:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>"<em>Josh is smart.</em>"</li>
					<li><strong>usually implies:</strong> It is not true that Josh is brilliant (i.e., "Josh is not brilliant")</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Downward-entailing environment:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>"<em>Josh is not smart.</em>"</li>
					<li><strong>usually <em>does not</em> imply:</strong> It is not true that Josh is not brilliant (i.e., "Josh is brilliant")</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<p class="centercol">For the first example, the alternative ("Josh is
			brilliant") entails the original utterance ("Josh is smart");
			the set of brilliant people is smaller than (and is completely
			contained within) the set of smart people. Hence, the implicature
			goes through. On the other hand, for the second example, the
			apparent alternative ("Josh is not brilliant") actually is
			entailed <em>by</em> the original utterance ("Josh is not
			smart"); the set of people who are not brilliant is bigger
			than (and completely contains) the set of people who are
			not smart. (The set of people who are not brilliant contains
			both average people and dummies; the set of people who are
			not even smart contains just the dummies.) Hence, "<em>Josh
			is not brilliant</em>" is not actually a stronger alternative,
			and thus it doesn't trigger any quantity implicature.</p>


		<h3 class="centercol">Problems</h3>
		<p class="centercol">Our analysis of alternatives so far still leaves
			some issues unsolved. Here we'll discuss two.</p>
		<p class="centercol">First of all, so far we have been looking at
			examples where a quantity implicature involves <em>denying</em>
			a stronger alternative. But there are many cases in which
			we implicate that a stronger alternative is true. Levinson
			(chapter 3.2.4) discusses several examples; here we'll just
			review the case of generalized conversational implicatures
			with "<em>and</em>".</p>
		<p class="centercol">As we've seen in previous modules, <em>X and
			Y</em> generally implicates <em>X and then Y</em> (e.g.,
			"<em>Sammy and Chris fell in love and got married</em>" suggests
			that they fell in love first and got married second). We could
			go even further; "<em>X and Y</em>" often implies that X
			<em>caused</em> Y to happen.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Consider, for instance, a
			sentence like "<em>I slammed the door and the picture fell off
			the wall</em>". There are several alternatives that the
			speaker could have uttered:</p>
		<ol class="center">
			<li><em>I slammed the door and then the picture fell off the
				wall.</em></li>
			<li><em>I slammed the door and that made the picture fall
				off the wall.</em> (Or some synonymous paraphrase of
				this, like <em>I slammed the door, causing the picture
				to fall off the wall</em>.)</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="centercol">These alternatives are progressively
			stronger. (1) entails the original utterance and the original
			utterance doesn't entail it, so (1) is a stronger alternative.
			Furthermore, (2) entails (1) and (1) does not entail (2), so
			(2) is even stronger than (1). According to the analysis
			we've done so far, a person uttering "<em>I slammed the door
			and the picture fell off the wall</em>" should be
			understood as implying that his slamming the door did not
			cause the picture to fall off the wall. But that analysis is
			clearly wrong; in fact we will usually interpret the utterance
			as meaning (2). So, there must be some other mechanism that
			causes the implicature in (2) to arise; furthermore, there
			must be some explanation of why a quantity implicature
			doesn't arise in this example.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Competence-based strong implicatures, which
			we discussed in the "<a href="../WeakStrong/">Weak and strong
			implicatures</a>" module, are a similar example. Just like
			the previous example, these implicatures involve going from
			a weaker proposition ("the speaker doesn't believe <em>P</em>")
			to a stronger one ("the speaker believes &#x00AC;<em>P</em>"),
			rather than denying the stronger proposition.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The second problem is how to decide which
			alternatives are relevant to the conversation. As we've
			seen above, an utterance can have many alternatives. For
			an utterance like "<em>I have lived in the USA and the UAE</em>",
			there are nearly 200 other countries I could have mentioned
			(depending on what we count as a "country"), plus over 18,000
			possible combinations of two other countries, plus over a
			million possible combinations of three other countries, etc.,
			such that the total number of alternatives is over 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
			(Geurts, chapter 6, suggests a way to avoid this problem by
			considering speakers' "intentional state" rather than
			specific alternatives they could have said, but I am not
			convinced that his approach solves the problem.)</p>
		<p class="centercol">In fact,
			for any given utterance or proposition, there are an
			infinite number of propositions that entail it (for example,
			"<em>That's a cat</em>" is entailed by "<em>That's a cat
			and I like ice cream</em>", "<em>That's a cat and I like
			ice cream and snails are slow</em>", etc.). Therefore,
			any utterance has an infinite number of alternatives.
			But it is clear that uttering that utterance does not
			imply the denial of most of these alternatives; if I
			point at a cat and say "<em>That's a cat</em>" then no
			one would think I am implying "It is not true that [that's
			a cat <em>and</em> I like ice cream]". So, people must
			have some way of deciding which alternatives are
			relevant (and thus might be denied, via quantity
			implicatures) and which are not. We will turn to this
			issue in the next module.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">In-class activities</h3>

		<center>

		<button class="collapsible">Brainstorming</button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>Have students think of another quantity implicature not discussed
			here and figure out what alternative it is based on, and how
			that alternative is stronger.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="collapsible">Trying and succeeding</button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>Saying someone "<em>tried</em>" to do something often implicates that
			they didn't succeed at doing it; for example, "<em><a href="https://www.quotes.net/show-quote/11809">I
			tried to save him</a></em>" suggests that the speaker didn't succeed at saving the person he was trying
			to save.</p>
		<p>At first this seems like a scalar implicature, just like how "<em>Josh is smart</em>" can suggest that
			Josh is not brilliant. It seems like <em>succeeded</em> is a stronger alternative to <em>tried</em>,
			so a speaker uttering "<em>I tried to X</em>" conversationally implicates that they don't believe
			they succeeded at X.</p>
		<p>There is a problem, though. Remember that in the module we said a "stronger alternative" is one that
			entails the expression which was uttered (e.g., <em>brilliant</em> is a stronger alternative for
			<em>smart</em> because <em>brilliant</em> entails <em>smart</em>). <em>succeed</em>, however, does
			not seem to entail <em>try</em>; as Huang (2014, section 2.2.2) points out, we can say "<em>He
			succeeded without even trying!</em>" and it's
			not a contradiction. This would not be possible if <em>succeed</em> entailed <em>try</em> (compare
			to, e.g., "<em>He saw a black cat without seeing any cats</em>", which is self-contradictory).</p>
		<p>Have students discuss how the implicature (i.e., the interpretation of <em>tried</em> as meaning
			"did not succeed") arises. Off the top of my head we have a few possibilities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We could say it's a different kind of implicature than the other examples in this module, and
				it doesn't arise based on alternatives but instead arises based on something else. This is
				sort of the approach that traditional neo-Gricean theory takes (see the discussion in
				Huang for more details&mdash;basically, the claim is that scalar implicatures,
				<a href="../Clausal/">clausal implicatures</a>, and so-called "alternative implicatures" like
				this one are three different sub-categories of quantity implicature), but it seems unsatisfactory
				to me because it treats this implicature as somehow different from scalar implicatures, whereas
				they seem almost exactly the same to me (at least to my naive intuition, which is not saying much)
				and it's not clear to me that they really behave in different ways other than with respect to this
				one detail about how the alternative doesn't entail the utterance.</li>
			<li>We could instead say that it's still the same type of implicature, but our definition of "alternatives"
				is flawed; i.e., alternatives aren't based on entailment, but on something else. Then, though,
				we will need to figure out how we can describe what counts as an alternative, in a way that
				can handle all the above sorts of examples (e.g. scalar implicatures, ignorance implicatures,
				and ad-hoc implicatures) as well as this example. That will be quite a challenge! (It may
				be worthwhile, though; for example, Huang [2014, chapter 5.2.3] describes how the meanings
				of alternatives like <em>come</em> and
				<em>go</em>, and <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>, could be explained as implicatures based
				on alternatives; these words don't seem to have entailment relationships to me, so if an
				implicature-based account of them is successful then that would be good motivation for why
				the concept of alternatives is useful beyond just entailment scales.)</li>
			<li>We could try to find a way to claim that <em>succeed</em> actually does entail <em>try</em>,
				and that the lack of contradiction in Huang's example ("<em>He succeeded without even trying</em>")
				is not due to lack of entailment but is an illusion caused by something else, like an implicature.
				It is not clear to me that this is possible, though, because it doesn't seem like
				bona fide implicatures can cause that sort of apparent contradiction in other examples
				(consider, e.g., "<em>He ate all the cookies without eating some of them</em>"; this
				seems like a contradiction to me, so the fact that the &lt;<em>all</em>, <em>some</em>&gt;
				scale can cause a contradiction in this way whereas the putative &lt;<em>succeed</em>,
				<em>try</em>&gt; scale does not cause any contradiction does seem like a serious challenge
				to anyone attempting to say that these are both the same sort of "alternatives").</li>
		</ul>
