		<h2>Make your word list (6 hours)</h2>

	<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&#x21B5; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Once you have prepared your word list, it's time to make the experiment. For this class we will use DMDX.</p>
<p class="centercol">The best tutorial for how to make an experiment in DMDX is <a href="https://psycholinguistics.indiana.edu/resources/dmdx-tutorial_id_2010.pdf">these
	slides by Isabelle Darcy</a>. I highly recommend you read them. I have also provided some explanation and tips below, but they just
	demonstrate a small subset of the things you can do with DMDX, and are not a complete substitute for reading through Dr. Darcy's
	tutorial, especially if you want to learn more than what is included here.</p>
<p class="centercol">For a step-by-step introduction to how to use DMDX, including example experiments, continue to the instructions
	below. Each step below includes a sample experiment, and an explanation of how that experiment was set up in DMDX. For each sample,
	you should first download the sample script, run it in DMDX so you can see what it does (see the "Reaction times" module for
	instructions on how to install DMDX and how to open an experiment in DMDX), and then read on in this page to understand how I created
	the experiment in DMDX.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">1. Simple "experiment" to get started</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="1_simple_experiment.rtf">1_simple_experiment.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">This was a really simple and stupid experiment. You should have just seen two "trials" in the experiment: one telling
	you to press the left Shift key, and one telling you to press the right Shift key. (They were in a random order, which means you
	might have had the left shift key first and the right shift key second, or you might have had the right shift key first and the left
	shift key second.)</p>
<p class="centercol">There are two important parts of this script. The first line (with lots of &lt; and &gt;) is the header, which
	specifies some general settings about how the experiment will run; we can ignore this for now. (In some later steps we will look in
	more detail at the information in the header; and for a more complete explanation, you can check Isabelle Darcy's slides.) The second
	part specifies what will happen in each trial of the experiment.</p>
<p class="centercol">Each line is one "trial", i.e., something that will show up on the screen. (In DMDX's terminology, this is called an
	"item".) A trial always begins with a number (positive or negative), which will be useful later when we want to analyze the results.
	 The "+" or "-" before the number
	tells DMDX what we expect the "correct" response will be; a "+" means we expect the person to press the right button, and a "-" means
	we expect the person to press the left button.
	The "/" character tells DMDX to erase
	whatever was on the screen before this trial. The "*" character tells DMDX to start counting time; later, when we analyze the
	results, the numbers you see will indicate how many milliseconds passed from the beginning of the timing (the "*") until when the
	person pressed a button. The part in quotation marks tells DMDX what to show on the screen during this trial. Finally, a trial always
	ends with a ";" character. (Pro tip: if you create a DMDX script and there is some error when you try to run it, one
	of the first things to check is whether any lines are missing the ";" character at the end.)</p>
<p class="centercol">So the first trial in our simple DMDX script can be understood to mean the following things:</p>
<ul class="center">
	<li>For this trial, participants should press the right button (because the trial starts with a "+");</li>
	<li>In the results file, the code indicating the results for this particular trial will be "1";</li>
	<li>The first thing that happens in the trial is: whatever was on the screen before gets erased;</li>
	<li>Next, DMDX starts keeping track of the time;</li>
	<li>Next, the text "Press the RIGHT SHIFT button now" appears on the screen;</li>
	<li>Finally, the trial continues until the person presses a button. (Technically, the trial ends when the person presses a button OR
		when 4 seconds have passed; whichever comes first. If you want to change this, you have to edit information in the header; see
		Isabelle Darcy's slides.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="centercol">To get a clearer idea what all this stuff means, let's take a look at the results file. After you ran the experiment,
	DMDX should have saved a results file (either an .azk file or a .zil file). Open that file now. Here's what the results file looks
	like for me (yours may be slightly different):</p>

<p class="centercol"></p>
<p class="centercol"></p>
<p class="centercol">Most of this stuff is not very important for us. The real data we are interested in is the last two lines.</p>
<p class="centercol">The first line of data says "1". That means that the trial shown there was the trial with code "1" (i.e., the one
	that said "Press the RIGHT SHIFT" button now).</p>
<p class="centercol">The second number in that line says "-563.12". There are two key pieces of information contained here. The "-" means
	that I pressed the "wrong" button. Recall that in the DMDX script, this trial has a "+" sign, meaning that we expected the person to
	press the right shift button. In the results there is a "-" sign, meaning I pressed the wrong button for this trial. The "wrong
	button" is the left shift button (since we told DMDX that the "correct button" is the right shift button). Therefore, we know that
	on this trial I pressed the left shift button. The other important information is the number, which tells us that I pressed the
	button 563.12 milliseconds after I saw the words appear on the screen.</p>
<p class="centercol">The second trial starts with a "2", which tells us that this was the trial with code "2" (the one where we were
	supposed to press the left shift button). There is no "-" by the result, which means I pressed the "correct" button&mdash;in this
	trial, the "correct" button was designated as the left shift key, so we know I pressed the left shift key. Finally, we know that it
	took me 382 milliseconds to press the button after I saw the words on the screen.</p>
<p class="centercol">That's the basics of DMDX. Now let's see how we can upgrade this experiment to be more like a real priming experiment.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">2. Lexical decision experiment</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="2_lexdec_experiment.rtf">2_lexdec_experiment.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">For your experiment, you're not just going to be showing people text that tells them "please press the shift button
	now". If you make a priming experiment, you're probably going to be showing them real words and fake words, and wanting them to press
	a button when they decide if they've seen a real word or not (if your priming experiment uses a lexical decision task). That's what
	this script does.</p>
<p class="centercol">Notice that the layout and format are almost identical to the stupid simple script we begin with. Only now, instead
	of presenting text that says "Please press the right shift button now", we are instead presenting text that shows a real word (like
	"DOG") or a fake word (like "PPAEL").</p>
<p class="centercol">Other than that, the setup is basically the same as before. Importantly, notice that we are using different codes for
	different words: this is so that in our results file, we can figure out which line is the reaction speed for "DOG", which line is
	the reaction speed for "NURSE", etc. Also notice that we are using "+" or "-" signs to indicate the expected responses: for all the
	real words we want the person to press the right button, so all the real words have codes beginning with "+", and all the nonwords
	have codes beginning with "-".</p>
<p class="centercol">There is one more important thing we have changed: the &lt;s&gt; part in the header. In the first stupid experiment
	example we did, the header included "&lt;s 2&gt;". Now, in this lexical decision experiment, it's instead "&lt;s 8&gt;". Why do you
	think that is?</p>
<p class="centercol">One hint: in the first stupid experiment we did, there were 2 trials. In this one, there are 8.</p>
<p class="centercol">&lt;s&gt; is short for "shuffle", and it controls how DMDX puts the trials into a random order. It's a little bit
	complicated. But what DMDX does is it divides the trials into "blocks", and it randomizes both the order of the blocks and the order
	of the trials within the blocks. Imagine what would happen if we used "&lt;s 4&gt;" in this experiment. This would mean that DMDX
	divides the trials into blocks, with 4 trials in each block. Our experiment has 8 trials:</p>
<ol class="center">
	<li>DOG</li>
	<li>TABLE</li>
	<li>NURSE</li>
	<li>BUS</li>
	<li>TALBE</li>
	<li>SUTEDNT</li>
	<li>PPAEL</li>
	<li>GBA</li>
</ol>
<p class="centercol">With "s 4", DMDX would arrange the first four trials into one block {DOG, TABLE, NURSE, BUS}, and the next four
	trials into another block {TALBE, SUTEDNT, PPAEL, GBA}. It would put those blocks in a random order (so sometimes {DOG, TABLE, NURSE,
	BUS} might come before {TALBE, SUTEDNT, PPAEL, GBA}; other times, it might come after). Then, DMDX will make the trials within each
	block all be in a random order: for example, the order for the first block might become {TABLE, BUS, NURSE, DOG} instead of {DOG,
	TABLE, NURSE, BUS}. A big problem with using "s 4" in this example is: the person would see all of the real words first, and then all
	of the nonwords later (or they would see all of the nonwords first, and then all of the real words later). The trials wouldn't be
	very well mixed together, and thus the participant might not need to pay close attention to the experiment (imagine if a participant
	sees 40 non-words in a row; eventually they will probably notice the pattern, and then they'll just be able to keep pressing the left
	button constantly, without really paying close attention to what's happening).</p>
<p class="centercol">One good solution is often to set up DMDX in such a way that each small block of the experiment will have an even mix
	of stimuli (for example, in a big experiment, I might set it up so that in every series of 12 trials, there are 3 related trials, 3
	unrelated trials, and 6 nonword trials). However, the easiest thing (and acceptable for the present project) is to just let the
	trials be in a fully random order. To do that, you can set the "s" parameter to be equal to the total number of trials in your
	experiment (not counting the practice trials), or set the "s" parameter to 1; either way should give you the same result (in this
	simple context).</p>

<h4 class="centercol">3. Priming experiment</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="3_priming_experiment.rtf">3_priming_experiment.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">The previous example experiment only had <em>targets</em>. If we want to make a priming experiment, then of course we
	need <em>primes</em> as well! To have primes, we need to figure out how to show <em>two words</em> in the same trial: a prime, and
	then a target.</p>
<p class="centercol">That's what this script does. Now notice that instead of just showing "DOG" (for example), it will show "cat", and
	then "DOG". Other than that, the script is basically the same as the previous one.</p>
<p class="centercol">This script shows us a few important things about timing in DMDX. When you ran the experiment, you should have
	noticed that the prime (like "cat") stays on the screen for a certain amount of time and then disappears automatically; then the
	target (like "DOG") stays on the screen either until you press the button or until a certain amount of time passes. Here's some more
	detail on how that all works.</p>
<ul class="center">
	<li>A trial consists of one or more "frames" (think of it as being similar to multiple Powerpoint slides), separated by "/". So, the
		first frame will show "cat"; the second frame will show "DOG". (I guess technically there is another "frame" before "cat", but
		it doesn't show anything, because there is no text in quotation marks for that frame; it's just a blank screen.)</li>
	<li>If the DMDX code for a frame includes a "*" character (like our "DOG" screen does), that is a frame where DMDX will expect the
		person to respond. Therefore, that frame will remain visible on-screen either until the person responds, or until a certain
		amount of time passes (the default is 4 seconds, but this can be changed with the "t" keyword in the DMDX script header).</li>
	<li>If the DMDX code for a frame does not include a "*", then DMDX fully controls how long that frame will remain on the screen. By
		default, this will be based on the "fd" keyword in the header (see Isabelle Darcy's slides for a much more detailed explanation
		of how this works). If you want to change the on-screen duration of any particular frame, it is possible; we will see an example
		later.</li>
	<li>The amount of time between trials (i.e., how much time passes after a person presses a button, before the next trial begins) is
		controlled by the "d" keyword in the DMDX header.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="centercol">4. Masked priming</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="4_maskedpriming_experiment.rtf">4_maskedpriming_experiment.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">If you're not doing masked priming for your project, you might not need to do the stuff in this step. But understanding
	how it works is still a good way to understand some of the functionality of DMDX.</p>
<p class="centercol">This script performed a masked priming experiment. In the "Priming" module you may have already learned what masked
	priming is; but this might have been your first chance to see what it actually looks like.</p>
<p class="centercol">In regular priming, the prime is shown on the screen, and then the target is shown; the participant sees both. In
	masked priming, on the other hand, the prime is flashed on the screen so quickly that the participant usually does not realize they
	saw it. (Another word for this is <em>subliminal</em> priming; "subliminal" means "below consciousness", i.e., something that you
	can't notice. You may have heard of the concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1knkpPd_0dg">subliminal messages</a>,
	which is when advertisers do things like flash the word "COCA-COLA!" very briefly in a movie or something, hoping that it will make
	you want to buy some Coke.) The awesome thing about masked priming is that priming effects still occur in these experiments, i.e.,
	people still respond to targets faster if there was a related prime than they do if there was an unrelated prime. In other words,
	even though participants never even realize that they saw the prime, they are still influenced by it!</p>
<p class="centercol">To turn our priming experiment into a masked priming experiment, there are two important changes in this script.
	First of all, we need to make the prime flash on the screen for a very short time, instead of staying on the screen long enough for
	people to notice. I accomplished this by adding &lt;ms% 50&gt; at the beginning of the frame for each prime. This tells DMDX to show
	the frame (i.e., the prime) for 50 milliseconds, instead of the normal amount of time.</p>
<p class="centercol">The second change is that I added another frame, showing just "########", before each prime. This is called a
	<em>forward mask</em>. Masked priming only works if the prime is "masked", i.e., covered up by some stimulus on the screen before and
	after it. If I just flashed the prime on the screen for 50 milliseconds, you actually would probably be able to notice it. (You can
	test this out by editing this DMDX script or the previous one, making the primes show up for only 50 milliseconds but not showing
	this ###### mask before it. If you run the experiment that way, you will probably be able to consciously see the primes.) To really
	make the prime un-noticeable, you have to make sure there is other stuff on the screen just before it and just after it. There
	already is going to be a target on the screen just after it, so we don't need to add anything for that. But in our original script,
	there was nothing on the screen <em>before</em> the prime. That's why I add this "#######", to function as a forward mask. When we
	have <em>both</em> a very short prime duration <em>and</em> masks before and after the prime, we can create a situation where
	participants do not consciously notice the prime&mdash;i.e., we can create a masked priming experiment.</p>
<p class="centercol">We now have the bare bones of a priming experiment; we can show primes (even masked primes, if we want) and targets,
	we can control how DMDX will put them in a random order, and we can record what buttons people press and how quickly they press them.
	Technically that's all we need; you could add more trials to this kind of script to finish making your experiment already. But there
	are still a few important things we can do to make this experiment better.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">5. Adding messages</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="5_maskedpriming_experiment_withmessages.rtf">5_maskedpriming_experiment_withmessages.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">Remember the priming experiment you did in the "Priming" module? Before the real experiment started, there were
	several screens of instructions. There was also a message at the end telling you the experiment is over. It's generally nice to
	include stuff like this. You don't want your participant to be faced with a mysterious blank screen at the end of experiment, and not
	knowing what to do; you want them to see a friendly message like "Thank you for helping with this experiment! Please notify me that
	you have finished".</p>
<p class="centercol">This example includes some messages in the experiment. There are two key things I have done to allow the experiment
	to have messages in it.</p>
<p class="centercol">First, notice that each "message" begins with a "0". Remember how every trial in the experiment starts with a code
	number like 1, 2, 3, etc.? A message is technically a trial (it's something that DMDX needs to show on the screen), so it also needs
	a code number. But I don't care about recording "results" for this trial (i.e., I don't care how long it takes the participant to
	press the button when they read a message). "0" is a special code just for these kind of messages. When a trial has a code of "0",
	DMDX will not include it in the results file; DMDX also won't put any time limit on it (as opposed to normal trials, which end
	after a few seconds if the participant does not press any button).</p>
<p class="centercol">The other important thing I added was some "$" signs. I didn't add those because I love money; I'm not some evil
	capitalist! The reason actually has to do with how DMDX arranges things into a random order.</p>
<p class="centercol">Keep in mind that DMDX will put all trials into a random order, based on the "s" keyword in your header, as we
	discussed before. But I don't want these messages to be in a random order. Otherwise, the message saying "Welcome to the experiment,
	here are some instructions", which <em>should</em> come at the beginning of the experiment, might end up coming at some other random
	place&mdash;even at the end of the experiment! I used the "$" signs to avoid this. Any trial with "$" signs before and after it is
	excluded from randomization. In other words, when DMDX tries to put the trials in a random order, it will completely ignore the ones
	that are "protected" by the $ signs, and it will leave them in the place they are supposed to be. This is how I can make sure that
	the message I want to show at the end of the experiment, will actually appear at the end of the experiment (instead of in some other
	random place).</p>

<h4 class="centercol">6. Improving the trial codes</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="6_maskedpriming_experiment_withmessages_betternumbers.rtf">6_maskedpriming_experiment_withmessages_betternumbers.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">This is a minor thing (and you might not even need to do it for your experiment), but I find it makes my life way
	easier.</p>
<p class="centercol">In the previous versions of the script, the "related" trials had codes of 1 and 2, the "unrelated" trials had codes
	of 3 and 4, and the "nonword" trials had codes of 5 to 8. I find this to be a little confusing; it's hard to remember which trials
	are which. I prefer to use something like the 'hundreds' place to handle this. (This is also how the trials were coded in the example
	experiment you did in the "Reaction times" module.)</p>
<p class="centercol">Check the codes in this new experiment. Do you see the pattern?</p>
<p class="centercol">Now, all the related trials are in the 100s: 101, 102, etc. All the "unrelated" trials are in the 200s (201, 202,
	etc.). And all the "nonword" trials are in the 300s (301, 302, etc.). I find it a lot easier to keep track of things if I do it this
	way. The hundreds place (1xx, 2xx, or 3xx) tells me whether the trial was related, unrelated, or nonword. And the remaining numbers
	(x01, x02, x03, etc.) tell me which target it was. (Keep in mind the Latin square design discussed before. For a target like BEE,
	remember that it could have a related prime like BUTTERFLY, <em>or</em> an unrelated prime like EDIT. Thus, if I designate BEE as
	target #1, then I can code BUTTERFLY...BEE as "101", and EDIT...BEE as "201". Then, when I am analyzing my data later, if I want to
	examine how fast people responded to BEE under any circumstances, I could look up the results for trials with codes of 101 or 201.)</p>
<p class="centercol">This can scale up; if an experiment has more conditions and variables, you can use bigger and bigger numbers. I did a
	long-lag priming experiment once that had three independent variables and 96 different items, so the trials had codes like "13224"; the
	ten-thousands, thousands, and hundreds digits each represent the condition on one of the variables, and the "24" at the end indicates
	that it's item number 24. Anyway you don't have to go that crazy for this project, but you can keep this in mind for future
	experiments.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">7. Practice trials</h4>
<ul class="center"><li>Script: <a href="7_maskedpriming_experiment_withmessages_betternumbers_practice.rtf">7_maskedpriming_experiment_withmessages_betternumbers_practice.rtf</a></li></ul>
<p class="centercol">Including practice trials is super important! Participants need some time to practice and get used to the experiment
	and the buttons, before they get into the "real" experiment. In the real experiment, a button press is assumed to reflect the outcome
	of several processes (e.g., seeing a stimulus, recognizing what word it is, deciding whether or not it's a real word). If a
	participant hasn't had sufficient opportunity to practice, then one of those processes might just be trying to remember which button
	is the "word" button and which is the "nonword" button&mdash;i.e., a person might quickly recognize that what they saw is a word, but
	then might need several seconds to think about whether that means they should press the left button and the right button. And early
	in the experiment, the amount of time this process needs might vary a lot across trials. Therefore, participants need to practice
	enough so that they can do this process pretty automatically, so it takes the same amount of time (hopefully a very short time) on
	every trial. I recommended having at least 20 practice trials before your real experiment begins.</p>
<p class="centercol">Of course, practice trials are only "practice" if they come at the beginning, before the real trials of the
	experiment. If they're mixed in random order with the rest of the trials, they're not really practice. Therefore, we need to make
	sure the practice trials all come at the beginning, and do not get randomly mixed together with the rest of the experiment. How can
	we do that?</p>
<p class="centercol">We can solve this problem the same way we solved the same problem with messages in example script #5. We put "$"
	signs before and after the practice section, to make sure it is does not get randomly mixed in with the rest.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">Wrap-up</h4>
<p class="centercol">With all that done, you essentially have a template for a priming experiment. You can use the example scripts I have
	provided, and edit them accordingly to add your own stimuli into the template. Of course, to do this successfully, you should have a
	good understanding of what you are editing. So, rather than just skipping to the end here and downloading the last script and
	starting to edit it, I strongly recommend you read through (either read through this page, or read through Isabelle Darcy's slides)
	to make sure you understand what you will be editing in this script.</p>
<p class="centercol">Any time you finish making a working DMDX script with all your words in it, you should test it on yourself (i.e., sit
	down and "do" the whole experiment). This is valuable for two reasons: to make sure it works and there are no errors, and to record
	some "data" which you can try out analyzing&mdash;the data won't really be meaningful, since you know too much about the experiment
	now (you are already very familiar with the words), but it's a good way to make sure you know <em>how</em> to analyze the data,
	before you start getting data from "real" participants. In the next section we will learn more about how to analyze data.</p>
