In this experiment we tried to see how far this effect generalizes, by trying it again with a few new twists. First of all, we tried doing the visual instead of auditory mismatch negativity. Secondly, we did it in Indonesian instead of English. And thirdly, instead of a past-present distinction, we tried two new distinctions: one between real words and nonwords, and one between nouns and verbs. We found that the visual mismatch negativity was sensitive to the difference between words and nonwords (sort of), but, surprisingly, not to the difference between nouns and verbs. This study raises questions about the limits of what sorts of abstract differences the mismatch negativity is sensitive to, and in what experimental paradigms.</p></details>

It has never been clear, though, whether this happens because passive-voice sentences are structurally more complex than active-voice sentences, or because they're less common. In a language like English, those things both happen to be true, so how can we disentangle them? Well, it turns out that in Indonesian, passive voice is used much more often than in English, such that its frequency is much closer to that of active voice. In this registered report, Bernard took advantage of that fact to try to answer that longstanding conundrum. It turned out that Indonesian passive-voice sentences still elicit different brain activity than active-voice sentences, which suggests that this difference is triggered by the syntactic structure of passive voice, not by how common or uncommon it is.</p></details>

But, in addition to having extra syntactic structure, in many languages they also differ in other ways&mdash;for example, they just have more words. This makes it hard to tell if the different brain activity they elicit is really because of their additional syntactic structure, or because of those other surface-level differences. In this study, Bernard solved that problem by taking advantage of sentence structure in Indonesian, where cleft sentences and simple sentences have the same surface word order and number of words (they're pretty much just distinguished by a prefix). We found that they still elicit that extra brain activity, even in Indonesian. This suggests that that brain activity is really due to abstract syntactic structure.</p></details>

It has long been thought to be an index of the brain's detection of any changes, including differences between abstract categories. That explanation had not been strongly put to the test, however, because almost all previous studies involved situations in which the difference between categories can be recognized based on some kind of physical cue. This study tested for abstract change detection by presenting listeners with purely abstract linguistic contrasts with no reliable physical cue: the difference between past-tense and present-tense verbs (as in, e.g., <em>chose sang bled swore clung <strong>pave</strong></em>). Amazingly, the brain still detected this sort of abstract contrast&mdash;even with no physical correlate, and even without listeners actively paying attention to these streams of stimuli. This provides the strongest evidence to date that the mismatch negativity really is an index of the brain's automatic detection of differences between abstract categories of stimuli.</p></details>

The authors had a DNA data problem that was computationally intractable for computers, so instead they "gamified" it into a puzzle game, "Borderlands Science", which they embedded within the popular looter-shooter video game <em>Borderlands 3</em>. Over the next few years, about 4 million people played "Borderlands Science", contributing a ton of puzzle solutions which led to actual breakthoughs in the processing of those DNA data. This paper describes that process, and how the approach can be used for other "citizen science" research endeavors. The authors generously listed "Borderlands Science players" as coauthors, and I am one of those 4 million people who played the game, so I'm sort of a coauthor on this paper. But I didn't make any contribution other playing a bunch of Borderlands Science (and enjoying some of that sweet sweet XP), so I'm really more of a participant than an author.

For example, if I say "<em>She finished the book</em>", you need to re-interpret what "<em>the book</em>" means, because a book is a <em>thing</em> which you can't actually start or finish. You can start or finish <em>doing</em> something; accordingly, we normally interpret "<em>She finished the book</em>" as meaning something like (depending on the context) she finished WRITING the book, she finished READING the book, etc. A lot of previous research has examined the process of reading structures like that, but much of that research has mixed together two different types of verbs: aspectual verbs (as in "<em>finished</em> the book") and psych verbs (as in "<em>enjoyed</em> the book"), which have different linguistic properties. In this study, Wenting systematically examined sentences with these two types of verbs separately, and found that only the aspectual type of verb elicited the abovementioned reinterpretation-of-object sort of processing costs.</p></details>

Importantly, this also happens if you recently saw a different "version" of that word, or another word that includes that same word; for example, you still get that speed-up for recognizing <em>cat</em> if the word you saw a few minutes ago was <em>cats</em>, or <em>catwalk</em>. This phenomenon is known as <em>long-lag priming</em>. In this study, we tried doing that with different pronunciation variants of Mandarin words. For example, the word written 打 is usually pronounced <em>da</em><sup>L</sup> (with a Low tone), but in some contexts it's pronounced <em>da</em><sup>R</sup> (with a Rising tone). Surprisingly, we found&mdash;across three experiments with a total of 458 participants, which is quite massive for this sort of research&mdash;that hearing one of these did not speed up people's responses to hearing the other one later, even though they are just different versions of the same word! This study, therefore, revealed that there are some up-until-then unknown limitations on the conditions in which long-lag priming can occur.

The results ultimately select that speech production doesn't just use stored forms; rather, during the process of saying words, we retrieve words' underlying forms but then do some mental computation to figure out how they're supposed to be pronounced in their particular context.</p></details>

Surprisingly, we found that hearing a different pronunciation of the word you expected is just as surprising (in terms of the brain activity it elicits) as hearing a totally different word. This suggests that there is some stage of language comprehension during which listeners are making predictions specific to certain forms of words, and not considering other possible forms that the same word could take.

The debate was kind of intractable because arguments in favor of the existence of linguistic injustice were based on speculation (like "here are reasons that it must be hard, right?") or on self-report (like "I had a hard time of it") or other methods that left a lot of confounds. What we did in this study was the first-ever blinded randomized-control-trial sort of study to show that scholarly work written in "non-native"-sounding English get judged as being less "scientific", even when its scientific content is identical to work written in "native"-sounding English. This makes it the first study to provide hard evidence that [one particular source of] linguistic injustice really exists.<br /><br />Since the advent of generative AI, there have been more and more papers saying something along the lines of "generative AI can help reduce linguistic injustice by helping people proofread their papers" and then citing <em>this</em> paper. (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10556656251357423#core-bibr20-10556656251357423-1">Here's</a> an example of a paper citing this one in support of a claim that journals should offer low-cost proofreading help, including proofreading by AI, and <a href="https://ajis.aaisnet.org/index.php/ajis/article/view/5875">here's</a> one suggesting that AI translation should be used to counter review bias.) I do not endorse that and I don't think our paper ever expressed such a position; while we didn't say much in the way of recommendations, what little we did say was squarely focused on how linguistic injustice should be reduced by <em>reducing reviewers' biases</em> (since reviewer bias is what this paper was actually about). We never recommended that it should be scholar-writers' own responsibility to use any tools to make their writing better conform to a certain variety of English, and I regret that we didn't make that clearer.</p></details>

For example, if you take a sound that's halfway between a [d] and a [t], people will be more likely to interpret it as a [t] if you put it in the context <em>_ask</em> (where [t] makes a real word "task") than if you put that exact same sound in the context <em>_esk</em> (where [t] makes a fake word *"tesk"). This paper reports an experiment in which we tried to see if the same effect would happen with contexts that make a common vs. an uncommon word; for example, would people be more likely to interpret this sound as [t] in <em>_ime</em> (where "time" is more common than "dime") and less likely to interpret it as [t] in <em>_or</em> (where "tore" is less common than "door")? It turns out that they're not: people's judgments of ambiguous sounds were influenced by whether the context makes a real word or a fake word, but <em>not</em> by whether the context makes a common or uncommon word.

A couple years before publishing this paper, Lei and I noticed a paper claiming that people with music experience are not susceptible to this perceptual illusion. We had some concerns with the data and statistical analysis being used to make that claim, and at the time Lei had just finished a psycholinguistics class and wanted more, so we decided to do our own replication of that study. We found that, contrary to the original study, musicians <em>do</em> still get the McGurk effect, and they do so just as much as everyone else.<br /><br />This paper also happens to be my first ever <em>registered report</em>. Registered reports are a special new way of publishing academic research. In the traditional way, you spend a long time doing some research and writing up a paper, then it goes out to reviewers, and it might get accepted for publication or the reviewers might be like "actually you were doing X Y and Z wrong all along, go redo it before it's publishable". In a <em>registered report</em>, on the other hand, you first send out your experiment plan to reviewers before actually doing the experiment, and they give you all that constructive criticism before you spend time actually doing the experiment. That way, once you actually start doing the experiment, you're doing something that's been carefully vetted and is guaranteed to be published, regardless of how the results come out (as long as you follow the plan that was vetted). This both saves researchers the time they would have otherwise spent doing experiments that might have had problems, and also removes the pressure to massage your data to make it look "publishable".</p></details>

That sounds nitpicky if you're not a statistics person. But it was (and unfortunately still is) very common practice for people to assume two conditions are not significantly different because "their error bars cross", and that conclusion is not necessarily right&mdash;as our figure in this paper shows, two conditions can have almost completely overlapping error bars but still be statistically super-significanlty different.

He noticed that one of the classic and influential studies in neurolinguistics, on which much of our understanding of how prediction works in language is based, had actually almost never been replicated&mdash;which is not ideal, since replication is the gold standard of reliability in science. Given how important it was to replicate that study, he assembled a massive team of neurolinguistics across nine different laboratories to run simultaneous high-powered replications of that study, all while confirming to the highest standards of scientific replicability (e.g., pre-registration). The publication of this study sparked about huge surge of interest in neurolinguistic studies on prediction, and brought the issue of replicability to greater attention within the neurolinguistics community. (This study often gets described as failing to replicate the study on which it is based, but that's a bit of a mischaracterization. We actually did find a small effect consistent with what they found&mdash;albeit one that we only detected in exploratory analysis. But we also found that that effect was <em>so</em> small that it could only be meaningfully measured/studied in truly massive studies, bigger than anyone was or is doing, and so all the research done before couldn't tell the field much about the nature of this effect.) My role, other than running one of those nine experiments, was to set up some of the experiment software (used in about half of the labs) and help with running and reporting the statistical analysis.

Specifically, the old study showed that by showing that how we interpret <em>some</em> impacts how fast we recognize some other words later on (because interpreting <em>some</em> as "not all" will make us expect those words more). This study dug deeper into that finding by using eye-tracking, which gives much more fine-grained measures of how people read. It allowed us to pinpoint what stage of processing is impacted by people's interpretation of <em>some</em>; specifically, it's the early, predictive sort of processing.

This happened regardless of how the sounds are physically realized (e.g., the difference between voiceless [s] and voiced [z] is physically quite different than the different between voiceless [t] and voiced [d]), and regardless of hwo the voiced-voiceless contrast is realized in the particular language (English is a language in which voiceless sounds are acoustically more "marked" than voiceless, whereas Arabic is the other way around, for example).

One reason is because it was really a process of pursuing scientific discovery. The whole experiment came from a "failed" experiment (which I later followed up in Politzer-Ahles & Im, 2020), and we just kept doing experiment after experiment to figure out what had gone wrong in that "failed" experiment, ultimately leading to these new, important, and totally unexpected discoveries. Another fun thing about it is that Luck (2014:137), essentially the brainwave bible, describes a hypothetical experiment like this (specifically, one testing the same manipulation on one group of participants who knows the language and one who does not) as being the best kind of experiment design but one that is extremely "difficult and time-consuming".

This was actually quite striking, because traditional theories of this sort of meaning processing had assumed that if there is any computational effort involved in realizing that "not all" meaning then it would be all-or-nothing (i.e., when you interpret <em>some</em> as meaning "not all" you work hard for it, and when you don't you don't). This study showed instead that that same computation can be hard or easy depending on how much contextual support there is. That finding is most consistent with a theory of processing that Judith Degen had recently proposed (which we discuss in more detail in the paper). Another thing I find important about this paper is a few paragraphs in the introduction which talk about experimental issues and confounds that need to be ruled out before you can conclude that an experiment really shows that implicatures (e.g., interpretations of <em>some</em> as meaning "not all") are hard to derive.

I presented this study at a conference in 2012, and the conference attendees were invited to later write up papers for a journal special issue. I did that, and after a few rounds of revision it was accepted for publication in 2014. Since then it seems like the editor was unable to wrangle revisions from all the other authors, one thing led to another, and the special issue never got published. So this paper has been "accepted for publication" since 2014 (so, for 11 years, as of my writing this in 2025) and probably will never actually be published. Several of my colleagues with other papers accepted for this issue withdrew them and published them elsewhere, but I never did with this one; since it's been cited a little, and is findable here and on other resources like the Internet Archive, hopefully it's "out there" enough to have done some good for the field, but I'm not really prepared to do any more with it.

The finding of this paper unfortunately remains pretty ignored; lots of current research still repeats the claim that pragmatic meanings (like the interpretation of <em>some</em> as meaning "not all") take extra cognitive effort, as if this claim is a done deal, even though this and several other studies since have contradicted that. From time to time (fortunately very rarely) this paper even gets cited together with a pile of other papers at the end of a sentence saying scalar implicatures are cognitively effortful, which is the opposite of what this paper claims.

For example, "I didn't even see <em>ONE</em> cat" suggests something like "...let alone ten cats!", whereas "I didn't even see one <em>CAT</em>" suggests something like "...let alone one dog". In this study, we used a technique called self-paced listening to examine how quickly people understand words as they are in the process of listening to sentences. We had expected that people might be slow to understand continuations that don't fit the stress (e.g., "I didn't even see <em>ONE</em> cat, let alone one dog"). Unexpectedly, though, we found that people didn't slow down in this situation. The results suggested that the impact of stress on the interpretation of "<em>even</em>" sentences might not be enough to influence the predictions people are making in real-time as the sentence is unfolding&mdash;or, alternatively, that the self-paced listening method is simply not sensitive to this sort of thing.</p></details>

Hyland argued that this idea is a myth which lacks actual evidence. We wrote this paper in response, arguing that linguistic injustice may be real&mdash;more specifically, Hyland had raised some arguments claiming that people who learned English as a first language have it just as hard as people who didn't, and we argued that those arguments were incorrect. Responses to this response ensued, and ultimately spurred a whole cottage industry of papers attempting to resolve this debate which Hyland's paper and ours sort of created. (Or, to be more specific: inklings of that debate were already present in the literature, but I think this pair of papers is what turned the debate into a "thing".)</p></details>

A lot of previous research has suggested that people listening to Mandarin speech cannot hear the difference between a "real" Tone 2 vs. a Tone 2 derived from what was originally Tone 3. But that research was all based on explicit judgments (e.g., playing a sound to someone and asking "which tone was that?"). In this study, we tested whether people can hear the difference between these tones using a less explicit / more unconscious method, visual world eye-tracking (in which people hear a sound while looking at a screen, and we measure where their eyes look). We found a very slight sensitivity to the difference: people looked a tiny bit more at the word corresponding to the tone they actually heard (e.g., when hearing a Tone 2 derived from a Tone 3, they looked a bit more at the word that matches that than at the word with a "real" Tone 2 in it).

We tested this pattern in Cantonese-English bilinguals, which is different from previous research because Cantonese uses a logographic writing system (in which characters represent words or meaningful parts of words), whereas previous research had been on pairs of languages with sound-based writing systems (in which characters represent sounds). We found, unlike previous research, no difference in the size of the priming effect as between loanword pairs and non-loanword pairs. One of the reasons this isn't published yet is that it needs a follow-up/replication experiment, and I haven't managed to do one yet; Kate and Rachel, my co-authors and the ones who did the lion's share of the leg work for this project, graduated and started working, and I haven't yet managed to succor someone new into working on this.</p></details>

So he redid our study, but in Cantonese instead of Mandarin this time (because Cantonese has more standalone monosyllabic words), and with both disyllabic and monosyllabic stimuli. Contra our previous study, this time we found bias effects for <em>both</em> real word vs. fake word, and common word vs. uncommon word. The effect is a bit weaker in disyllables than monosyllables, but still present (so the use of disyllables doesn't in of itself explain why we didn't find an effect in our previous study).

I don't do research this way anymore.<br /><br />This paper compared children with and without autism in terms of how they understand certain types meanings in language (specifically, those known as "presuppositions" to semanticists and pragmaticists). Previous research had suggested that children with autism don't understand presuppositions as often as children without autism do, but it wasn't clear whether this is specifically because they have autism or if it was an epiphenomenon of other differences between kids with and without autism.

I can barely even understand it anymore!<br /><br />What I really remember about this work on Uyghur genitives (possessives) is less the syntax side, but more the semantics/pragmatics side that I thought about a little bit later (but never wrote up for anything bigger than a class project). Here's what's interesting about them. Most of the time in most languages, possessive structures like "Kasim's kids" pressuppose that the thing they are talking about exists: in other words, if I say "Kasim's kids such-and-suched" then I am presupposing that I believe Kasim has kids. So it would sound quite weird to say "Kasim's kids such-and-such" in a situation where I don't think such kids exist (i.e., where I don't think Kasim has kids). In Uyghur, on the other hand, "Kasim's kids don't exist" is precisely how you could say Kasim doesn't have kids. Uyghur doesn't really have any verb that you could translate to English "<em>have</em>". Rather, the way you say someone has or doesn't have something is to say that the thing exists or doesn't exist. So to say Kasim has kids or Kasim has a pencil, you literally say "Kasim's kids exist" or "At Kasim there exists a pencil". And on the flip side, to say Kasim doesn't have kids or Kasim doesn't have a pencil, you say "Kasim's kids don't exist" or "At Kasim there does not exist any pencil". I find the "Kasim's kids don't exist" sort of sentence an interesting challenge to traditional semantic theories of presupposition, which propose that definite descriptions like "Kasim's kids" automatically trigger presuppositions; it seems like they don't automatically trigger presuppositions in this case! (Although to be fair, it would be a bit like bullying or beating a dead horse for me to use this example to beat up on traditional semantic theories of presupposition, because those theories have already taken a pretty serious beating over the last 50 years.)</p></details>
