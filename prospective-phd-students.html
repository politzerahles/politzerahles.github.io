		<h2>Information for prospective PhD students</h2>

		<p class="centercol">If you are considering contacting me to inquire about applying for PhD study
			with <a href=".">me</a> at the
			Hong Kong Polytechnic University, please note the following information. (You are welcome to
			contact me anyway with any sort of questions, but I am providing this information to save you
			time because it is likely that your questions are already answered here.)</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Two routes to PhD funding</h3>
		<p class="centercol">A PhD here is a funded position, which means you aren't asked to pay for it; the
			university pays its PhD students from a limited pool of money, which means there is a limited
			number of slots available. They won't accept your application unless they can pay for your PhD
			study.</p>
		<p class="centercol">At this university there are two two ways to get funded. One is to be directly
			hired by some professor who has funding to carry out some project. The other is to be funded by
			the <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/hkpfs/">Hong Kong PhD Fellowship</a> or by the department
			or university directly. I will explain these below.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Project funding</h3>
		<p class="centercol">Regarding the first mechanism, I do not have any funding to hire a PhD student
			in the 2022-2023 academic year, so I cannot offer funding through this route, no matter how
			good your application is.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Fellowship funding</h3>

		<h4 class="centercol">The basic mechanism</h4>
		<p class="centercol">The second mechanism needs a bit more explanation. There are several different
			funding sources (in addition to the Hong Kong PhD fellowship, each university, and each faculty
			and department within each university, has its own pile of money for PhD students), but they all
			go through the same application mechanism.
			Departments nominate applicants to their school, schools nominate applicants to their university,
			and universities then nominate applicants to the Hong-Kong-wide competition. Nominees whose applications are
			unsuccessful at one level will get funded by the lower level; e.g., if the university nominates
			someone to the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship and they don't get it, then the university will use its
			funding to pay for that person's PhD study. What this means for you is that you only have a chance
			of getting accepted through this mechanism if you can convince the department that your application
			will be competitive for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship; the department won't even consider applications
			that it thinks aren't competitive for that fellowship. To understand what is considered competitive
			for that fellowship, read the criteria below.</p>

		<h4 class="centercol">The university's selection criteria</h4>
		<p class="centercol">Some additional caveats are in order regarding this second route. Our university has
			some very specific things it looks at when it considers what sort of application "could be competitive
			for a Hong Kong PhD Fellowship". I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize, they basically
			only care about how famous your undergraduate institution was and how high your undergraduate GPA was;
			they pay little attention to the quality of your application materials, proposal, recommendation
			letter, etc., or to your master's degree. Furthermore, they are unlikely to even consider your
			application if your undergraduate degree is from any Chinese university other than Shanghai Jiaotong,
			USTC, Zhejiang University, Tsinghua, or PKU. I find these criteria stupid and I don't support the
			university's choice to use them for evaluating PhD applications, but I am not the one who makes
			decisions on PhD applications; I am just passing this information to you to help you make decisions
			when preparing your PhD applications.</p>

		<h4 class="centercol">My own selection criteria</h4>
		<p class="centercol">If you can clear the abovementioned bar for Hong Kong PhD Fellowship applications
			(i.e., if you graduated from an undergraduate institution that is sufficiently prestigious), then
			you might be competitive for that fellowship, and you are welcome to apply. Your application will
			go to a committee in our department who will review the applications and choose a small number to
			nominate up to the next level, as described above. At that stage you will need support from one
			or more professors who are interested in your research proposal and ideas; this
			support is not itself sufficient to get accepted (as mentioned above, the department cares more
			about the ranking of your undergraduate institution than it does about anything else), but it is
			necessary, since as far as I know an application still won't progress without support from at least
			one professor who expresses a willingness to work with you. Different professors have different
			opinions and different criteria on which they evaluate applications, since they are different
			people with different views and beliefs. Personally, I care a lot about an applicant's research
			plan, because (1) a PhD in Hong Kong is a fairly quick degree without a lot of coursework, so
			a PhD student needs to already have a good idea what they want to do, unlike in the United States
			where I was able to spend the first several years of my own PhD dithering around figuring out my
			interests; and (2) even though you probably won't end up doing exactly the same research as what
			you write about in your proposal, the proposal is still a way for me to see what sorts of ideas
			you can come up with, how clearly you can express research ideas, and what sort of thinker you
			are. Therefore, for me to consider supporting a PhD application, I would place a lot of weight
			on the quality of the research proposal and/or writing sample.</p>

		<h4 class="centercol">Take-home message</h4>
		<p class="centercol">If you believe you meet the university's criteria for Hong Kong PhD Fellowship
			applications, as well as my own criteria about the research proposal and writing, feel free to
			get in touch with me. If you do not meet those criteria, you are still welcome to contaact me
			but I am providing this information so you can realistically evaluate your chances.</p>
