<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="centercol">Here I am going to walk through how to print a research poster on fabric using Spoonflower, a website where people can
	create and print their own fabric designs. You upload a design, and they print it on fabric and ship it to you. This site is mainly
	meant for people to design and sell their own pillowcases and things like that but academics have discovered that it's also a great
	way to print out conference posters.</p>


<ul class="center">
	<li>Benefits</li>
	<ul class="center">
		<li><strong>Transportation</strong>: A fabric poster is easier to travel with than a paper poster. You can fold it up in your luggage
			and you won't have to carry around a tube.</li>
		<li><strong>Cost</strong>: This method may be cheaper than normal printing, depending on what you have available. For me it was about $30
			a poster (including the poster itself and the shipping) when I did this in June 2024, whereas printing the same poster on paper
			through my university would have been around $50.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Drawbacks</li>
	<ul class="center">
		<li><strong>Wait time</strong>: It may take about a week (if you pay for rush delivery) or two (normal delivery) to get your poster.
			This means you have to prepare your poster far enough in advance.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p class="centercol">This information is based on an excellent tutorial, <a title="How To Design a Fabric Research Poster with PowerPoint" href="https://blog.spoonflower.com/2018/07/24/how-to-design-a-fabric-research-poster-with-powerpoint/">How To Design a Fabric Research Poster with PowerPoint</a>, by Dr. Angela Proctor of Codetta. I am mainly just highlighting the parts of it that are most relevant to my colleagues.</p>


<h2>Preparing your poster</h2>

<p class="centercol">For the purpose of this walkthrough, I am assuming you already have a poster made, at the size you want, in either PowerPoint or PDF format.</p>

<p class="centercol">Spoonflower needs an image file (JPG or PNG). So you're going to need to convert your poster file into one of those. In the process, there
	are two things you'll need to do to make sure the image will make a nice poster: set the right resolution, and rotate it to landscape format if it's currently portrait format.</p>

<h3 class="centercol">Image resolution</h3>

<p class="centercol">Spoonflower recommends using images that are at least 150 dpi ("dots per inch"); I use 300 dpi to be sure. (If you're not sure what the
	relationship is between your poster size and dpi, see <a title="Sizing Your Design" href="https://support.spoonflower.com/hc/en-us/articles/204444610-Sizing-Your-Design">Sizing Your
	Design</a>. The size of your image in pixels will be, for each dimension, inches*dpi. For example, if my poster is going to be 35" wide by 47" tall,
	and I want its resolution to be 300 dpi, then the image file will be 35*300=10,500 pixels wide, and 47*300=14,100 pixels wide. This will be a very
	large file!</p>
<p class="centercol">There are a few ways to adjust your image resolution:</p>
<ul class="center">
	<li>The method Dr. Proctor describes in
	<a title="How To Design a Fabric Research Poster with PowerPoint" href="https://blog.spoonflower.com/2018/07/24/how-to-design-a-fabric-research-poster-with-powerpoint/">How To Design a Fabric Research Poster
	with PowerPoint</a> is to save the poster as a PDF and then use the web tool <strong><a title="Convert My Image" href="https://convert-my-image.com/">convert-my-image.com</a></strong>
	to convert that PDF into a JPG with 300 dpi.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, if you're proficient with image software such as Photoshop or the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GNU
	Image Manipulation Program</a>, you can directly edit DPI in there. Keep in mind that increasing the dpi makes the dimensions smaller, all else being equal.
	So I first increase the dimensions of the image to account for that. For example, when I save a PowerPoint file as a PNG image, it seems to be saved with
	96 dpi by default. (In GNU Image Manipulation Program you can check the dpi of an image by going to the Scale Image tool, in the Image drop-down menu; this shows the current resolution.) Thinking about my above example of a 35x47" poster: if it's 35 inches wide with 96 dpi (meaning that 35*96=3360 pixels are distributed
	over 35 inches), then when I increase the dpi to 300 it's going to squeeze the same number of pixels ito 3360/300=11.2 inches, making my poster smaller.
	If I want 300 dpi over 35 inches, meaning 35*300=10,500 pixels, I need to first make it that big (using the Scale Image menu). Then, after enlarging it,
	I can go back to the Scale Image menu to change the resolution to 300 dpi, which will make it go back to the original size, but now with a higher dpi. (You
	could skip the resizing step if you just made your poster 3x bigger than necessary in PowerPoint to begin with. But, as mentioned above, these instructions
	are assuming that you already have the poster in PowerPoint or PDF at the size you actually want it.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="centercol">Rotating portrait-oriented posters</h3>
<p class="centercol">The steps that we will be following later produce a poster in landscape format (more wide than it is tall), and I don't know a way to change
	them. That means that if your poster is going to be in portrait format (more tall than it is wide), you'll need to rotate it 90 degrees so it's lying on its side.
	Save that rotated image; that's the image you'll be uploading to Spoonflower later.</p>


<h2>Printing your poster</h2>

<p class="centercol">After completing the above steps, you should now have a high-resolution image of your poster (either PNG or JPG), and it should be in landscape
	orientation (either it was already a landscape-format poster to begin with, or it was portrait-format and you've lain it down on its side so it fits into
	a landscape-oriented canvas).</p>
<p class="centercol">Next you're going to have to upload your poster to Spoonflower, choose the appropriate settings for printing it, and finally check out and pay.</p>

<h3 class="centercol">Uploading your poster</h3>

<p class="centercol">If you don't have a Spoonflower account yet, you'll have to make one, by clicking the "Join" link at the top.</p>
<p class="centercol">Once you're logged in to your account on the website, there are a few ways to get to the upload page. You can click on the account icon (which
	looks like a little person, on the upper right of the page) and there should be a prominent "Upload Design" button. Alternatively, you can go to your "Design
	Library", and there should be an "Add Design" button there.</p>
<p class="centercol">From there, simply choose your image file, click "ok" or "agree" on everything it asks you, and wait for it to upload. Since this is a huge file,
	it will take several minutes. When it's done, you'll be at a design page, showing you a preview of how your poster would look on several different kinds of
	material. It will look like this:</p>

<center><image src="designpage.png" width=75% alt="Screenshot of the design page on Spoonflower" style="border: 1px solid #555"></center>

<h3 class="centercol">Fabric and design settings</h3>

<p class="centercol">The material we want to use is "Fabric" (for me, this is the first one in the list). Click the "Edit" button in the corner of that one.</p>

<p class="centercol">In the page that's brought up now, under the "Repeat" drop-down menu, choose "Center". This will make sure your image is shown once, centered on the
	canvas. (If you don't change this, it will be repeating in a tile pattern, which is great for duvet covers and wallpapers but not so great for a conference
	poster.)</p>

<p class="centercol">Also check the dimensions below this, and scale them if necessary to match the size you want your poster to be.</p>

<p class="centercol">The screenshot below shows where these two things are in the editing page. When you're done fixing these settings, click Save to return
	to the design page.</p>

<center><image src="editingpage.png" alt="Screenshot of the pattern editing page on Spoonflower" width=75% style="border: 1px solid #555"></center>


<h3 class="centercol">Ordering</h3>

<p class="centercol">Back at the design page, find the "Fabric" design again, but this time click "Buy" instead of clicking "Edit". This will bring you to a page where
	you'll select the options for the fabric you'll use.</p>

<p class="centercol">Under "Fabric", choose "Sport Piqué". And under "Size", choose 'Yard 56" x 36"'.</p>

<p class="centercol">Once that's done, add it to your cart and check out when you're ready. Enjoy your spiffy new fabric poster when it arrives a week or two later!</p>
