		<h1>How confident are you about confidence intervals?</h1>
		<h2>An introduction to within-subject confidence intervals</h2>

		<p class="centercol">You probably are used to seeing plots with error bars on them;
			<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2016.1151058#_i15">here's</a> a recent example
			(-slash-shameless-plug) from a recent paper of ours. But do you know <a href="https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI?t=1m16s">what they mean?</a></p>

		<p class="centercol">No matter how good at stats you are, you often can't tell what error bars mean.
			Unfortunately, people use error bars to illustrate many different things, and even more unfortunately, oftentimes
			they do not indicate what the error bars actually are. The best thing to plot with error bars is confidence intervals
			(see, e.g., <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/manual/related/cumming-and-finch.pdf">Cumming &amp; Finch, 2005</a>), but
			people often use them to plot other things, such as &#x00B1;2 standard errors (a rough approximation, sometimes,
			of a 95% confidence interval), one standard error, or even one standard deviation. This is problematic because people
			looking at a plot usually try to make statistical inferences based on the error bars (e.g., "The error bar for this
			condition doesn't cross the mean for that condition, so the difference is significant!"), but these inferences are only
			licensed for certain kinds of error bars; an inference based on how a 95% confidence interval works (e.g., "The bottom
			of the error bar for this condition only just barely touches the top of the error bar for that condition, therefore
			<em>p</em>&#x2248;.01")  would be invalid if you're actually looking at error bars showing 1 standard error (a much
			narrower range than a 95% confidence interval). Furthermore, the fact that error bars can mean so many different things
			often causes researchers confusion about their own results: I often hear people asking questions along the lines of
			"Why do my stats come out significant but my error bars cross?", or vice versa. Therefore, it's important to know what
			the different kinds of error bars are, and to know which kind to use on any given plot. Not only does this help you
			present your data more honestly, but it also can help you be more confident about results that you're seeing.</p>

		<p class="centercol">In this essay, I will assume that we all accept that error bars should show [95%]
			confidence intervals (CIs) and that we should indicate this in our figure captions;<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup><a name="f1_intext"></a>
			if you are not yet convinced of that, do check out Cumming &amp; Finch (2005), linked above. What I will discuss here
			is a tougher issue: that of how to plot error bars for a <em>within-subjects</em> design. As you probably know, the formula
			for the confidence interval of a parameter estimate (like a sample mean) is
			<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Mean &#x00B1; (SD / sqrt(N) * <em>t</em><sub>critical</sub>)</span></strong>: i.e., if you have a mean
			based on 24 participants, you take the standard deviation of the 24 participants' means, divide by the square root of 24,
			and multiply by what the critical <em>t</em>-value would be for a <em>t</em>-test on this mean (as N gets higher and
			higher, this critical <em>t</em>-value for &#x03B1;=.05 approaches 1.96) and finally you add and subtract this value from
			the sample mean. As we will see below, however, this standard CI
			formula is not always appropriate. In particular, for a plot of different within-subjects conditions, CIs based on this
			formula will lead you astray. Nonetheless, in psycholinguistics we are usually interested in
			within-subject comparisons, and therefore once we all agree to plot CIs instead of standard errors or something else, we
			run into a new challenge, the challenge of how to plot meaningful error bars for within-subject comparisons. Below we'll
			discuss why this matters, and how to solve the problem using Cousineau (or Cousineau-Morey) CIs.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Standard CIs, and why they are not appropriate for within-subjects designs</h3>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="https://web.uvic.ca/psyc/masson/LM94.pdf">Loftus &amp; Masson (1994)</a>
			explain and illustrate why it's a problem to use typical between-subjects CIs in a plot showing within-subjects manipulations.
			This is highly recommended reading, but to make a long story short, trying to make inferences about within-subjects effects
			based on a between-subject CI in a graph is often misleading, because a typical between-subjects CI only shows the variation
			between subjects within a given condition, whereas you are interested in making paired comparisons with another condition.
			To put that another way: a typical between-subjects CI provides a rough estimate of where that condition's mean might really
			be in the population.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup><a name="f2_intext"></a> However, for a within-subjects experiment, we typically don't care about
			the population mean for each condition; we only care about the population mean of the <em>difference</em> between two (or more) conditions.
			For example, in a semantic priming study where we compare people's response times when they have to read aloud target words
			(like <em>doctor</em>) preceded by associatively-related primes (<em>nurse</em>) or by unrelated primes (<em>table</em>), we
			generally do not care about estimating the population mean of the response time for primed words and that of the response
			time for un-primed words; we only care about finding the unprimed-primed difference, for each subject, and using those
			differences to estimate the population mean of the difference. (And then, usually, all we care about is whether or not that 
			population mean might be zero; if our CI suggests that the difference is not likely to be zero, we call it
			"statistically significant" and celebrate, while the real statisticians weep and gnash their teeth as they behold our over-reliance on statistical significance.)</p>

		<div style="width:55%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
		<img src="figure/CummingFinch2005fig.png" title="Cumming and Finch 2005 figure" style="float:right" alt="A figure illustrating two group means and a difference with error bars" class="plot" />
		</div><p class="centercol">The solution Cumming &amp; Finch (2005) recommend for this problem is to plot, instead of or in addition to the
			condition means, the <em>difference</em> of interest, along with its CI. The CI for the difference can be computed as a normal
			between-subject CI, using the familiar CI formula, since we are interested in how much this difference varies between subjects. To the
			right is an example (Figure 3b from Cumming &amp; Finch, 2005) illustrating this. The two dots represent condition means and their
			between-subjects CIs, while the triangle, which is on its own scale off to the right, represents the mean of the paired difference,
			and the CI of that mean difference.</p>

		
		<p class="centercol">Let's create a plot like this using some real psycholinguistic data, as a starting
			point for playing around with different kinds of CIs. The data are from
			<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063943">Politzer-Ahles and Fiorentino (2013)</a>
			and can be downloaded from there. The R code for recreating the plots is available at the bottom of this post (also note that,
			while I'm using R here, everything I'm describing can also be done in Excel or whatever your preferred software is). Without going
			into too much detail about the experiment, I'll just say this this was an experiment where we looked at how quickly people
			read a critical part of a sentence, as a function of two factors about the preceding context: whether one of the preceding
			sentences used the quantifier <em>some</em> or <em>only some</em> (this factor we called Quantifier) and whether another
			preceding sentence used the quantifier <em>any</em> or <em>all</em> (this factor we called Boundedness). We were interested
			in the simple effect of Boundedness at each level of Quantifier; for theoretical reasons that I of course find interesting
			but that are irrelevant here, we predicted a significant effect of Boundedness in the <em>some</em> stimuli (such that
			reading times would be slower after <em>any</em> than after <em>all</em>) and no comparable effect in the <em>only some</em>
			stimuli. Here's how the results look, in a plot<sup><a href="#f3">3</a></sup><a name="f3_intext"></a> somewhat following Cumming &amp; Finch's
			suggestion, with separate dots for each simple difference (on their own axis, which is on the right), and with <em>p</em>-values
			(from paired <em>t</em>-tests<a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4_intext"></a>) added so we can tell if the confidence
			intervals are a reasonable reflection of the significance level:</p>
		<center><img src="figure/CIexample1.png" alt="Untitled2"  /></center>

		<p class="centercol">We see here that the between-subject CIs of the differences (calculated using the familiar between-subjects CI formula:
			<strong><span style="color: #008000;">SD / sqrt(N) * <em>t</em><sub>critical</sub></span></strong>) look reasonable: both
			simple effects are significant at a=.05, and both error bars fail to cross zero. So everything is as it should be. (Of course, if we
			were using this plot in a paper, we should also have given it a descriptive caption that explains what the differences represent&mdash;i.e.,
			which condition was subtracted from which&mdash;and what the error bars represent.) Let's see
			how things would look if we had used this same CI formula to add CIs to the condition means themselves:</p>

		<center><img src="figure/CIexample2.png" alt="Untitled2"  /></center>

		<p class="centercol">Suddenly we have nonsense! If we looked at this plot with only the bars and between-subject CIs on the bars, without
			the difference CIs and p-values, we would have incorrectly concluded that there are no
			significant simple effects here. Hopefully this, along with the similar examples in Loftus and Masson (1994), convinces everyone
			that plotting a between-subjects CI on each bar is misleading if you are interested in making inferences about within-subject
			differences.</p>

		<h3 class="centercol">Alternatives to standard CIs for within-subject comparisons</h3>

		<p class="centercol">Above we already saw one solution to the problem of plotting CIs for within-subject comparisons: you can plot
			a difference and its CI, rather than (or in addition to) plotting the individual condition means. This is fine and
			straightforward when you only have two conditions to compare. But it can quickly get out of hand, as Cumming and Finch (2005)
			also note. In the above plot we showed two differences rather than one, and the plot is already getting clunky, and that's
			without even plotting two more simple effects that we could have plotted (the effects of Quantifier at each level of Boundedness),
			plus the two main effects, plus the interaction. All of those could, in theory, have been plotted in the same way as we plotted
			the two simple effects of interest. The problem gets even more complicated for a factor with more than two levels, where there
			are multiple possible pairwise comparisons that could be plotted. Imagine how badly the problem scales for a 2x2x4 design (e.g.,
			in <a href="pubs/Politzer-AhlesZhang_2014_JCL.pdf#page=21">Politzer-Ahles &amp; Zhang, in press</a>).
			It becomes unfeasible to show all possible pairwise differences on a plot.</p>

		<p class="centercol">Of course, you can strategically plot just the pairwise differences that are relevant to your hypothesis, like we did
			in our sample plots above. But it would be ideal to plot the data in such a way that a reader interested in other comparisons that
			you haven't considered can still make those comparisons. (Hopefully you also make your data available so readers can pursue these
			comparisons; however, it would be ideal to make this information available at a glance in the plot, and in some contexts, like a
			conference talk, you usually can't give the data to the audience.) What would be ideal is an error bar that can be put on an
			individual condition mean to help people make inferences about the difference between that mean and any other condition they want
			to look at. Fortunately, <em>within-subject confidence intervals</em> have been developed and can serve roughly this purpose.<p>

		<p class="centercol">What we want in a within-subject CI is for it to license the same kinds of inferences as a between-subject CI does.
			Lucky for us, Cumming &amp; Finch (2005) provide guidelines for what kind of inferences can be made based on visual inspection of a 
			pair of between-subjects CIs. Check their paper for the detailed guidelines; here's a quick summary:</p>
			<ul class="center">
				<li>If two error bars overlap by about 50%, then probably <em>p</em>&#x2248;.05.</li>
				<li>If two error bars just barely touch at the edges, then probably <em>p</em>&#x2248;.01.</li>
			</ul>
		<p class="centercol">Now we just need to test out within-subject CIs to see if they conform to these expectations for our sample data,
			where we already know that one difference is at <em>p</em>&#x2248;.031 and the other at
			<em>p</em>&#x2248;.006.</p>

		<p class="centercol">The first kind of within-subject CI is that proposed by Loftus &amp; Masson (1994), which is based on terms from the
			repeated-measures ANOVA table. I don't use this one, for a few reasons. First of all, for a stats dummy like me, it's a pain to calculate. Secondly,
			it calculates equal-sized CIs for each condition, whereas I generally want a unique CI for each condition, since sometimes one
			condition has more variance than another. Finally, and most importantly, the size of the CIs depends on the comparison you want
			to make: you need to make different CIs for looking at a certain main effect versus another main effect versus a certain interaction, etc.
			Of course, there is a reason for this: the test statistics for different effects are indeed different. However, this leaves us at
			the same quandary we discussed above for complex datasets, and thus I would prefer a kind of CI that allows for testing just about
			any pairwise comparison (at the expense of main effects and interactions; those I usually discuss in the text and don't worry about
			directly illustrating in a plot).</p>

		<p class="centercol"><a href="http://www.tqmp.org/RegularArticles/vol01-1/p042/p042.pdf">Cousineau (2005)</a> describes another method of
			calculating within-subject CIs which addresses all these problems. It is simple, it allows a unique CI for each condition, and it
			is not dependent on the comparisons tested. (In fact, Loftus &amp; Masson, 1994, also describe such a method in their appendix, but
			I find this method easier so it's what I use.) This method turns out to be slightly biased: it gives slightly smaller CIs than the
			Loftus &amp; Masson method. <a href="http://pcl.missouri.edu/sites/default/files/morey.2008.pdf">Morey (2008)</a> updated the formula
			for these CIs to correct for the bias, so nowadays CIs derived by this [updated] method are known as "Cousineau-Morey CIs".</p>

		<p class="centercol">I won't go into detail on how Cousineau-Morey CIs are calculated; the formula is actually quite simple, both papers are
			very accessible and easy to read, and there are some nice tutorials online
			(<a href="https://motorbehaviour.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/confidence-intervals-in-within-participant-design-a-tutorial-on-the-cousineau-morey-method/">here</a>
			is a very clear one; plus, my R code below includes a [hopefully] handy function to compute these CIs automatically; implementations can
			also be found in, e.g., <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-011-0123-7">Baguley, 2012</a>, and 
			<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-013-0441-z">Cousineau & O'Brien, 2014</a>). Let's forge
			ahead and test out these CIs to see if they match up to the inference criteria that we want. Here's a new plot, with 95% Cousineau-Morey
			CIs, rather than standard between-subject CIs, shown on each bar. As usual, the code is available at the end of this post.</p>

		<center><img src="figure/CIexample3.png" alt="Untitled2"  /></center>

		<p class="centercol">Things look much better now. On the left-hand side, where we know <em>p</em>&#x2248;.031, the bars do indeed appear
			to overlap by about half (i.e., one bar reaches about halfway up the other bar, and vice versa). And on the right-hand side, where
			we know <em>p</em>&#x2248;.006, the lines only just barely cross. This comes close to the criteria outlined in Cumming &amp; Finch
			(2005), although in both cases the <em>p</em>-value I might guess from visual inspection is probably a bit higher than the real
			<em>p</em>-value we observed in a quick-and-dirty <em>t</em>-test. In fact, the code below can be used to re-making the plot without
			Morey's bias correction if we want to try it. Doing this will get slightly narrower error bars, but given that the method is known
			to be biased I believe the error bars are shown here are probably better. Even though they appear to be a bit wider than we might
			have expected based on Cumming &amp; Finch's criteria, it must be noted that these criteria were
			originally defined for between-subject CIs rather than within-subject CIs (and direct comparisons between two condition means within a larger
			set of condition means was never the main purpose of Cousineau's CIs; see, e.g. Baguley, 2012), and they are just rough rules of thumb
			anyway. In any case,
			these within-subjects CIs are clearly better (in the sense that they more accurately reflect the conclusions we would make on the
			basis of the statistical tests) than standard CIs. Just keep in mind that these CIs are no longer necessarily estimates of the likely range of values of the population
			mean of a condition (like between-subject CIs are), but rather are more like a handy heuristic for making statistical inferences about
			within-subject comparisons.</p>

		<p class="centercol">It would be worthwhile to try out this comparison on more datasets, and especially on simulated datasets, 
			to try to lay out some rules of thumb for inference based on visual inspection of within-subject CIs, comparable to Cumming &amp;
			Finch's rules of thumb for inference from between-subject CIs. (It's entirely possible that this has already been done.)
			It will also be worthwhile to further explore another CI method which I haven't discussed here: non-parametric CIs estimated from
			mixed-effect models on multiple bootstrap replicates of the dataset (these will be particularly useful for psycholinguistic data with crossed subjects and
			items, since these do not require aggregating over items like I have done throughout this example; in the limited tests I have done
			with these CIs, however, they come out looking more like the between-subject than the within-subject CIs; see Baguley, 2012, for a
			more detailed comparison between different types of within-subject CIs). Nonetheless, as should be
			clear from this demonstration, Cousineau-Morey CIs will give more a more or less meaningful glimpse of
			the statistical significance of pairwise comparisons, and are far superiour to using the standard between-subjects CI formula
			on within-subjects data. Of course, these won't be appropriate for every case; in cases where you are interested in illustrating more
			complex patterns, or directly showing the CI of a test parameter (such as a difference or difference of differences) then you may need
			to consider the Cumming &amp; Finch (2005) or Loftus &amp; Masson (1994) methods.</p>

	<h3 class="centercol">Take-home message</h3>

	<ol class="center">
		<li>If you're interested in making within-subject comparisons, don't show standard, between-subject confidence intervals.</li>
		<li>"Confidence intervals", and error bars in general, can mean a lot of different things. Don't just blindly slap on bars (in Excel, ggplot2,
			or whatever you use for plotting) without knowing what they represent. Think carefully about what you want to show and what kind of
			inferences the viewer should be able to make from the error bars in your plots.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 class="centercol"> Notes</h3>

	<p class="centercol">I myself did not know about within-subject CIs until fairly recently (as indicated by the number of my own papers that show bad
		error bars). I believe it was <a href="http://tallinzen.net/">Tal Linzen</a> and <a href="http://aswhite.net/">Aaron White</a> who brought
		this whole concept to my attention.</p>
	
	<p class="centercol">
		<a href="#f1_intext"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a>The observant reader may notice that in my own paper that I linked at the beginning of
			this post, I broke this rule; that figure shows &#x00B1;2 SE bars rather than 95% CI bars. I also broke this rule in
			all my other papers that are mentioned in this post. We all have skeletons in our closet.<br />
		<a href="#f2_intext"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a>This is a simplification; technically, what a between-subjects 95% CI for a given parameter
			(like a mean) means is that, if
			you repeat this experiment an infinite number of times and make a 95% CI for that parameter in each experiment, 95% of those CIs will
			contain the true (population) parameter. It is not technically the case that a 95% CI of the mean for a given experiment is 95% likely to contain the
			true mean. I personally think it's fair, however, to make the inference that for a given study
			your 95% CI is more likely to be one of the hypothetical 95% of CIs that does contain the population mean rather than one of the
			hypothetical 5% of CIs that does not, unless you have reason to believe otherwise (e.g., if you know based on previous literature that
			the mean you just found is implausible). Nonetheless, it is good to keep the true meaning of  a CI in the back of your mind, because CIs
			are widely misinterpreted even among psychology researchers who are highly experienced in applied statistics
			(<a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic477909.files/misunderstood_confidence.pdf">Belia, Fidler, Williams, &amp; Cumming, 2005</a>;
			<a href="http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/HoekstraEtAlPBR.pdf">Hoekstra, Morey, Rouder, &amp; Wagemakers, 2014</a>).<br />
		<a href="#f3_intext"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a>Here I'm using a barplot, going against the advice of many smart people who advocate
			avoiding barplots when possible (here's one <a href="https://pagepiccinini.com/2016/02/23/boxplots-vs-barplots/">example</a> from
			Page Piccinini). I have another
			post forthcoming explaining my argument in favor of still using barplots sometimes. Long story short, for this essay I chose to use barplots
			because I was going to be adding extra dot doodads on the plot, so I wanted to keep the plots as simple as possible and avoid having a lot
			of other distracting stuff going on. You are welcome, of course, to use the data and the code here to re-create these examples using,
			e.g., violin plots, bean plots, or <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-pirate-plot-2-0-the-rdi-plotting-choice-of-r-pirates/">pirate plots</a>.<br />
		<a href="#f4_intext"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a>To keep things simple I've aggregated the trials for each condition and each subject,
