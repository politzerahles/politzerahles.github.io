		<h1>How to ask for a better grade</h1>

		<p class="centercol">At the end of each semester, professors* like me get lots of messages from students
			asking if there's anything they can do to increase their grade. Perhaps you are preparing to send
			a message like that to me or someone else; or perhaps you have recently sent one and been told "no".
			Either way, here is some advice on how to increase your chances of getting a positive response
			when you ask for a better grade.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The key to effectively asking about how to increase your grade is to understand what
			professors care about. So, in what follows, I'm going to talk about what professors care about and
			how it may differ from what you care about as a student; then I'll break down why certain sorts of
			requests (that don't address what professors care about) usually don't work; and finally, I'll
			provide some tips about how you can use what professors care about to frame your requests in a way
			that they are more likely to respond positively to.</p>


		<h2 class="centercol">What you care about</h2>
		<p class="centercol">Before we talk about what professors care about, let's examine what you care about as
			a student, and how that informs the way you ask for better grades.</p>
		<p class="centercol">As a student, you probably care a lot about your grades. You are pretty much constantly
			surrounded by messages telling you how important grades are&mdash;that you need good grades to
			keep your funding, to secure good opportunities outside of school (whether those be employment,
			graduate study, fellowships, etc.), or even just to validate that you are a good student. Some of
			this messaging may be true and some may not be; some of the importance of grades may be a good thing
			and some may be a bad thing; but I am not here to make judgments about that right now. The bottom line
			is, whether it's a good or bad, whether it's right or wrong, the reality is that you are in a situation
			where you have plenty of reason to feel that your grades are very important. Your professors realize that.
			All this is to say, if you ask for a better grade, I get where you're coming from.</p>
		<p class="centercol">But when you use this as the justification for requesting a better grade, I imagine
			you probably are not often successful. Imagine you send an e-mail at the end of the semester asking
			your professor if there's anything you can do to bump your grade up from a C to a B, because you
			need a B to keep your financial aid. Does this work? I imagine that a lot of professors in that
			situation would tell you, "If you knew that you needed a B, you should have worked hard throughout
			the semester to make sure you got a B; at this point it's too late to do anything." Maybe you have
			even gotten a response like that before; I know I've sent my own fair share of judgy e-mails like that.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Why do requests like this usually not work? Because they are focused on what <em>you</em>
			want or need, and neglect what your professor cares about. If you want to have more success in
			asking for better grades or for ways to increase your grade, you should understand what professors
			do care about, and how to use that to your advantage. So let's turn to that now.</p>

		<h2 class="centercol">What professors care about</h2>
		<p class="centercol">This might come as a surprise, but most of your professors
			<em>do not care about grades</em>. They care about your learning. Different professors have different
			views of grades, but these views are always based on how the grades relate to your learning.</p>
		<p class="centercol">I would roughly organize professors into four groups, based on
			how they view grades. Two of these groups like grades, one feels neutral about them, and one dislikes them.**
			But what they all have in common is that they do not care about grades for grades' own sake; they
			only care about how grades relate to your learning. To better understand how your professors
			might think about grades, let's take a closer look at each of these groups.</p>
		
		<h4 class="centercol">Grade users &ndash; "<em>Grades are a tool</em>"</h4>
		<p class="centercol">These professors use grades as an incentive to get you to learn. They start by
			thinking of some task or project that they would like you to do because they believe it will
			get you to learn something (for example, maybe they want you to conduct an experiment because
			it will help you learn how to do research; maybe they want you to write a computer program
			because it will help you get practice in using certain software design principles; maybe they
			just want you to come to class, because you'll learn better if you're in class).
			They attach a grade to it to motivate you to do the work. These professors probably have
			a positive outlook on grades, but not because they "like" grades in of themselves; they 
			only like grades insofar as grades can be a useful tool to get you to learn. The grade
			is not the goal, it's just a means to an end.</p>
		
		<h4 class="centercol">Grade communicators &ndash; "<em>Grades are information</em>"</h4>
		<p class="centercol">There is another kind of professor who has a pretty positive outlook towards grades: those
			who value grades as a tool to measure learning and to improve classes. These professors might
			not use grades as a carrot or stick to get you to learn like the abovementioned group does,
			but these professors do use grades as a form
			of feedback for themselves or their departments. They look at grades to figure out what
			students are doing well at and not so well at, and they then use that
			to revamp classes and better ensure that students are learning what they should learn.
			They also view grades as a way to communicate to stakeholders outside the university
			(such as potential employers) about how well you've done.
			These professors, like the group described above, are using grades as a tool, albeit
			for a different thing: they're not using grades as a tool to make you learn, but as a
			tool to improve their classes and to document your performance.</p>
		
		<h4 class="centercol">Grade tolerators &ndash; "<em>Grades are a chore</em>"</h4>
		<p class="centercol">These professors give you a grade because they have to. They want you to
			learn and that's what they really care about, but they assign grades to that learning
			because the university requires it. Grades are something they could take or leave; as
			long as you are learning, that's what these professors care about, and they would
			probably be perfectly happy never giving a grade if they weren't required to. Some of these
			professors pretty much treat grades as an afterthought. Others, however, do put a lot of thought
			into how they design tests, assessments, and rubrics, and they often have very well
			thought-out grading schemes. But even when their grading scheme is very well designed,
			they aren't doing it because they cherish the sanctity of what a B- means or anything
			like that; they are doing it because grading is just something they have to do.</p>	
	
		<h4 class="centercol">Grade haters &ndash; "<em>Grades are a barrier</em>"</h4>
		<p class="centercol">These professors believe that grades are antithetical to learning. They
			think that the mere existence of grades stifles learning and encourages behaviour that
			is not conducive to learning, while at the same time discouraging the sort of risk-taking
			and exploration that leads to true learning. They believe that learning would
			be better if there were no grades. These professors may be part of the growing
			"ungrading" or "going gradeless" movement. They might still put a grade onto your
			transcript at the end of the semester (because, as discussed above, they are usually
			required to), but they don't design the whole class around grades, and they do everything
			they can to minimize what they see as the harms of grading, while putting off all the
			grade talk as long as possible.</p>

		<h2 class="centercol">Why asking "How can I improve my grade?" doesn't work</h2>
		<p class="centercol">As we have seen above, your professors don't care about your
			grade. Some of them think grades are a useful tool for incentivizing learning or for
			documenting your performance; some think grades are a chore they
			have to get through; and some think grades are a scourge. But what they all have in
			common is that none of them care about grades for grades' own sake. At best, they
			think grades are something they can use to get you to learn; at the other extreme,
			some professors actively want to discourage you from focusing on grades.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Let's link these ideas back to the example we started with&mdash;a
			scenario in which you approach a professor at the end of the semester to ask if there's
			anything you can do to increase your grade from a C to a B because you really need a B.
			How would each kind of professor think about that request?</p>
		<p class="centercol">The <em>grade users</em> will not be interested, because what you're asking
			to do is not something that would accomplish what those professors want. If a professor
			uses grades to get you to learn, then they will feel that a last-minute request to
			increase your grade is not something that's going to lead to learning. For them, the
			whole point of the grade was to get you to do some work that would cause you to think
			deeply and learn. Something you hurry to submit at the end of the semester just to get
			a grade is probably not going to lead to that sort of learning. Giving you a higher
			grade just because you need it would undercut <em>their</em> purpose for using grades
			which was to get you to learn something.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Likewise, the <em>grade communicators</em> will think that changing your
			grade is going to throw off the accuracy of the measurement they want to get from your
			grade. If they want the grade to measure how well you're learning, then they would
			not want to muddy it by letting it be influenced by factors unrelated to learning, such
			as how much you need a B. They want grades
			to measure learning, so if any factor other than learning (such as personal need) is
			influencing the grade, then the grade is doing a worse job of measuring learning. So,
			once again, these kinds of professors are not likely to want to give you a higher grade just
			because you want or need it.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The <em>grade tolerators</em> will not be interested because they aren't
			particularly interested in grades, they are interested in what you're learning and
			how well you are learning it. By asking them to figure out ways to increase your
			grade, you are pretty much asking them to spend more time thinking about something
			they already don't want to be thinking about. The fact that they don't want to
			think about it doesn't necessarily mean they won't think about it&mdash;thinking
			about grades is, after all, usually part of their job&mdash;but if your request only
			focuses on how much you want or need a better grade then you are really not putting
			your best foot forward in how you approach these professors.</p>
		<p class="centercol">The <em>grade haters</em> will react in much the same way as the grade
			tolerators, because they too care more about what you're learning than about what
			grade you're getting. When you come to them asking for a better grade, you are
			focusing precisely on what they want you to not be focusing on. It's not even just that
			they themselves don't want to be thinking about grades; they actively want to get <em>you</em> to
			stop worrying about grades, too, because they believe you will learn better once you
			are freed from the oppressive shackles of the grades mindset.</p>
		<p class="centercol">No matter what sort of professor you have, just asking them how
			you can increase your grade is never likely to get a good response&mdash;especially if
			you're doing this at the very end of the term. When you just
			ask how to increase your grade, you are not focusing on what the professor cares
			about and wants you to care about.</p>

		<h2 class="centercol">Using what professors care about to frame your request</h2>
		<p class="centercol">So now you understand what your professors care about: they don't care
			about your grade, they care about how well you are learning. You also now understand
			why just asking about how to increase your grade is not likely to fly with most
			professors. But how can you do better?</p>
		<p class="centercol">If you know what professors want, you can frame your request in
			terms of those things. A professor doesn't care if you "get a good grade", they
			care if you learn. So, instead of asking for a better grade, ask for an opportunity
			to learn better. Instead of telling them how much you want or need a better grade,
			tell them why a better grade would better reflect what you have learned. Let's
			take a closer look at each of these strategies.</p>
		<h4 class="centercol">Strategy #1: Another chance to learn</h4>
		<p class="centercol">Most professors would rather see you learn than see you get a bad grade.
			So, if you bombed a test or did poorly in a project, show that you understand where
			and how your work fell short, and show that you are interested in trying to do a better job and learning the thing
			more deeply than what your previous work showed. That may involve having another chance
			to do it, or it may involve an alternative assessment that would push you to learn
			what you didn't learn while doing the original assessment. I can't guarantee that
			every professor will give you this opportunity (we are busy people and don't always
			have the time to design a whole new learning opportunity for you), but I can
			guarantee that you will succeed more often by framing this as a request for another chance
			to learn, rather than a request for a higher grade. This is
			especially more likely to work if you demonstrate a willingness to meet your professor
			halfway and work together to figure out something you can do, rather than just
			asking them "Is there anything I can do?"</p>
		<h4 class="centercol">Strategy #2: Another way to demonstrate what you've learned</h4>
		<p class="centercol">Most professors are also open to the idea that their grades might
			not accurately reflect what you have learned. For example, I teach linguistics,
			and I am much better at recognizing good ideas about linguistics
			than I am at designing tests and rubrics. I have many years
			of experience and expertise doing and evaluating linguistics research, and I simply do not
			have as much experience and expertise at things like curriculum design and
			pedagogy. Furthermore, as an educator, I am always thinking critically about how I am
			assessing my students' learning and whether I can do a better job of it. Throughout
			my years of teaching, I have had some students who do well on paper and get good grades
			but who really don't impress me at all when I interact with them some time after
			the class is over; and, on the flip side, I have had others who didn't get good
			grades and don't look good on paper but who have surprised me with deep and critical
			insights someday later. The upshot of all that is, I am deeply aware
			of the possibility that the way I'm grading you might not be doing a good job
			reflecting how much you've really learned. And most professors are just like
			me in this respect. If you tell a professor that you think you have learned a
			certain topic pretty well but that the grade you got on that assignment didn't
			reflect how well you've learned, and that you are interested in exploring other
			options to prove what you know, then many professors will be receptive to this.
			Hippie professors like me eat that shit up.</p>
		<h4 class="centercol">Additional tips: Fake it 'til you make it, and address this early</h4>
		<p class="centercol">I am not saying you need to believe in your heart of hearts that you
			really want to learn the stuff. You might think everything I've said so far
			is hippie B.S.; maybe you really just want the grade and don't care about all
			this touchy-feely "learning" nonsense. Still, if you want that grade, just fake
			it. Pretend that you want to learn better, or pretend that you just really want
			to show the professor how much you've learned. That will increase your chance
			of getting the better grade; furthermore, if the professor does take you up
			on this and works with you to figure out an opportunity for you to earn a
			better grade, then you might actually learn something from the process, even
			if that wasn't your main goal. You get what you wanted&mdash;the better grade&mdash;and
			the professor gets what they wanted&mdash;you learning something. It's a win-win
			for everyone!</p>
		<p class="centercol">Finally, for any of this to work, it needs to happen early. Learning
			takes time; hammering out an extra project in the last couple days before grades are
			due is not likely to lead to any real learning. Likewise, figuring out other ways
			to show your learning takes time, and a professor who has lots of final papers to
			grade already will probably not have enough time to sit down with you and figure
			out alternative assessments. Finally, talking to your professor early makes both of
			your lives easier, because if you're having this discussion in the middle of the
			semester then you might not even need to figure out alternative ways of learning
			and assessing your learning; you might be able to just talk about ways to do
			better on the things that already planned (e.g., upcoming tests or projects), which
			is generally a lot easier than figuring out something new.</p>
		<p class="centercol">For either of the strategies I have described above
			to be convincing, you should be approaching your professor long before the end
			of the semester&mdash;the middle of the semester is ideal&mdash;to start a dialogue
			about this. If you're in finals week now and thinking about sending that e-mail,
			then you probably will not have much success and there's probably nothing left
			you can do about this class&mdash;but at least now you know about these strategies
			for next semester.</p>



		<h2 class="centercol">Conclusion: don't ask for a better grade, ask to co-create a learning opportunity</h2>

		<p class="centercol">So, what's the best way to ask for a better grade? The short answer
			is: don't. At least, not for its own sake. What you should really ask for is
			another chance to learn what you need to learn, or another chance to demonstrate
			what you have learned, or both. Either of those might also result in a better
			grade, but the grade itself is not the point; learning, and showing your learning,
			is the point. Again, I cannot guarantee that this will work on every professor
			or in every class,*** but I am confident it will work far more often than "how can
			I increase my grade?"; at the very least, professors will be more willing to work
			with you if you approach them the way I have described here.</p>





<!-- something about extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation -->






	<hr>
<p class="centercol">*I am using the term "professor" loosely to refer to the instructors of any university-level
	classes; technically, not all of them are professors, but asking them for a better grade works the
	same way as asking professors for a better grade.</p>
<p class="centercol">**In reality things are not so clear-cut; your professors are humans and have complex personalities
			just like anyone else, so they probably all exhibit some features of each of these groups, or
			may even shift between different grade philosophies from time to time or from class to class.</p>
<p class="centercol">***Another issue I haven't addressed at all is fairness. Some professors may not want to grant
	you this request, even if you use one of my strategies to frame it, because they might be concerned that it's
	not fair to other students who don't get the same arrangements as you are asking for. I don't have any
	special tips for satisfying that kind of professor, but here my advice about timing still applies: the
	earlier you broach this subject with your professor, the better chance they'll be willing and able to find
	a way to work with you that they will think is fair.</p>
