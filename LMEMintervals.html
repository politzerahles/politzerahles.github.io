		<h2>LMEM-based intervals for error bars in graphs</h2>

		<p class="centercol">In <a href="https://www.tqmp.org/RegularArticles/vol13-1/p075/index.html">Politzer-Ahles (2017)</a> I proposed
			(translation: pulled out of my behind) a new way for calculating "confidence intervals" for displaying error bars in
			graphs of data from mixed-effect designs. The goal of these was to make it easy to look at a graph with means and error
			bars, and easily tell whether any pair of conditions is likely to be significantly different from each other. (Traditional
			confidence intervals do now license this sort of interpretation, for reasons explained in the paper.) I refer to these
			intervals as "LMEM-based intervals".</p>
		<p class="centercol">That paper also included code for calculating those kinds of intervals, but it could be very slow. At the
			time I wrote the paper, I believed that bootstrapping was the most accurate way to estimate p-values (and hence confidence
			intervals) from a mixed-effects model. And bootstrapping a complex model can take hours&mdash;as you may have discovered
			if you ever tried running that code.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Since then, however, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0809-y">Luke (2017)</a>
			has demonstrated that the best method is in fact not confidence intervals, but is instead the approximations provided
			by methods implemented in the <code>lmerTest</code> package. This is good news for the whole mixed-effects world because
			it gives us permission to use this easy method and not have to bother with the complicated and slow process of bootstrapping
			mixed-effects models. It's also good for my particular LMEM-based interval method, because it means we can calculate the
			intervals based on degree-of-freedom approximations from <code>lmerTest</code>, rather than waiting hours for bootstrap
			samples to run.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Here I present updated code for calculating LMEM-based intervals, as well as a very brief toy example to
			demonstrate how to use the code.</p>

		<h3>The code</h3>
		<p class="centercol">You can find the code in <a href="LMEMinterval.R">LMEMinterval.R</a>; it's also copied at the end of this
			page. It is written as a function. The way I use this is by just copying and pasting the whole code there into my R session
			(usually after I've done whatever other processing I want to do with my data), and then calling the function.</p>


		<h3>A worked example</h3>
		<p class="centercol">We will use the dataset <a href="URIS_priming_data.csv">URIS_priming_data.csv</a>. These are data from
			a priming experiment. For each participant, each word ("Item") was presented in one of three conditions ("Prime"): it was
			either preceded by an identical prime, preceded by a morphological prime, or unprimed.</a>
		<p class="centercol">After downloading the file to your computer, read it into R:</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code># Read in the data<br />URISdata <- read.csv( file=file.choose(), header=T )</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">Before calculating the LMEM-based intervals, we can take a look at the pattern of participant means.
			We see that the identical condition elicited numerically faster reaction times than the other two conditions. On the other,
			hand, there was little difference between the morphological and the unprimed conditions.</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code># Look at the condition means<br />( means <- tapply( URISdata$RT, URISdata[,"Prime"], mean ) )</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">Now we are ready to calculate the LMEM-based interval.</p>
		<p class="centercol">First, copy and paste the function (from the end of this page, or from LMEMinterval.R) into R.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Next we'll need to call the function. We'll need to put in several parameters when we call it:</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>The <code>formula</code> parameter takes an lme4-style model formula, specifying the dependent variable, the independent
				variables, and grouping variables (random effects). For this, we will use <code>RT ~ Prime + (1|Participant) + (1|Item)</code>.
				(Note that, unlike in a real mixed-effects model, the specific structure of each random effect doesn't matter here.
				We are only specifying that there are participants and there are items; we don't need to specify exactly what random
				effects [slopes and intercepts] there are for Participant and what random effects there are for Item. Even if you
				put that information in, this function will not use it.)</p>
			<li><code>data</code> is the data object. In this case, "URISdata".</li>
			<li><code>conf</code> is .95 by default (for a 95% interval). That is fine for our purposes, so we don't need to change it.</li>

		</ul>
		<p class="centercol">With all that decided, let's run the function and get the intervals:</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code># Calculate the margins of error for the intervals<br />( MoEs <- LMEMinterval( RT ~ Prime + (1|Participant) + (1|Item), URISdata ) )</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">What you see here is the margin of error (i.e., how far the interval goes up and down from the mean) for each
			condition. I prefer to instead use the difference-adjusted margin of error, which is the margin of error times &#8730;2:</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code>MoEs * sqrt(2)</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">What can you do with this information? Well, you can interpret it as follows: <strong><em><span style="color:red;">For
			a pair of conditions, when one condition's difference-adjusted interval does not include the other condition's mean (and vice versa),
			these two conditions are likely to be significantly different.</span></em></strong></p>
		<p class="centercol">You can make those comparisons if you make a table of each condition's mean and its interval's lower and upper bounds
			(i.e., mean &#177; difference-adjusted MoE). It's easier to see that information in a graph, so let's quickly review how to make a
			simple barplot with error bars.</p>
		<p class="centercol">We already calculated the condition means above. We can make them into a barplot; I'm saving some information about
			the barplot in the object "xvals" because we're going to use that later to know where to put the error bars.</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code>xvals <- barplot( means )</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">This works, but the scale is so big that the bars look about the same. To see things more clearly, we need to
			zoom in to where the actual differences between conditions are. To do that, we'll restrict the y-axis. I happen to know that the
			lowest LMEM-based interval in this set of data doesn't go below 1000, and the highest doesn't go above 1100, so we'll set the
			y-axis limits to [1000, 1100]; when you do this with your own data you may need some trial and error to find what looks right.
			(This isn't dishonest. Some people claim that zooming in on the graph like this makes differences
			look bigger than they really are. But we're about to put error bars here, which will make it easy to see how big or small the
			differences are. As long as you have informative error bars, your graphs don't need to always go to 0.) We'll also use the
			<code>xpd=F</code> parameter to not show the part of the bar that goes beyond the bottom of our graph (this just makes the
			graph look prettier.</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code># Create a barplot<br />xvals <- barplot( means, ylim=c(1000,1100), xpd=F )</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">Now it's time to add the error bars. I use the <code>arrows()</code> function for this. This makes a series of arrows
			(which we can stretch to turn into bars) at the places we specify. We need to give the x- and y- coordinates of the beginning
			of each arrow, and the x- and y- coordinates of the end. The x-coordinates are the middles of each bar, which we saved in the
			object <code>xvals</code>. The y-coordinates are the upper and lower bounds of each interval, which you will recall is
			mean &#177; difference-adjusted MoE. So the code to make the error bars is as follows:</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code># Add error bars to barplot<br />arrows( xvals, means - (MoEs*sqrt(2)), xvals, means + (MoEs*sqrt(2)), code=3, angle=90, length=.1 )</code></p>
		<p class="centercol">(<code>code=3</code> tells the <code>arrows()</code> function to put arrowheads at both the beginning and end of
			each arrow. <code>angle=90</code> stretches the arrowheads to be at a perpendicular 90-degree angle to the line, so they look
			like error bars. And <code>length=.1</code>specifies how long the horizontal "caps" on the error bars are; this one may take
			some trial and error to get looking right in your own data.</p>
		<p class="centercol">What do we see from this? The "morphological" and "unprimed" conditions' means are each within the other condition's
			interval, which tells us these conditions are probably not significantly different from one another. On the other hand, the
			"identical" condition's mean is outside of the other conditions' intervals, and likewise those conditions' means are outside
			the "identical" condition's interval; this tells us that the "identical" condition is probably significantly different from
			each of those conditions.</p>
		<p class="centercol">For convenience, here's the code for getting the intervals and making the graph, compiled in one place:</p>
<p class="centercol" style="border:1px solid #000; border-style: dotted; padding:10px; background-color: white;"><code>URISdata <- read.csv( file=file.choose(), header=T )<br />
# paste in the LMEMinterval() function<br />
( MoEs <- LMEMinterval( RT ~ Prime + (1|Participant) + (1|Item), URISdata ) )<br />
( means <- tapply( URISdata$RT, URISdata[,"Prime"], mean ) )<br />
xvals <- barplot( means, ylim=c(1000,1100), xpd=F )<br />
arrows( xvals, means - (MoEs*sqrt(2)), xvals, means + (MoEs*sqrt(2)), code=3, angle=90, length=.1 )</code></p>

	#		this function is able to handle functions in DVs (e.g., using log(RT)
	#		rather than RT as a DV), but not in IVs. And I haven't done much testing
	#		of DVs with functions so there may be bugs; I prefer just creating a 
	#		new column in the data frame (e.g., creating a logRT column).
	#		Also note that this is currently only implemented for single-factor

	# Figure out the DV
	DV <- vars[1]

	# Figure out what the random effects are. The first line finds which
	#	IVs look like random effects terms (which ones have pipes), and 
	#	the next line grabs the stuff after the pipe
	ranef_idx <- which( unlist( lapply( vars, function(x){ length( grep("|", x, fixed=T ) ) } ) )>0 )
	grouping.vars <- unlist( lapply( vars[ranef_idx],

	# Figure out the fixed IVs
	IVs <- vars[-c(1,ranef_idx)]

	###	which requires first calculating a temporary model [which may not 
	###	converge] and then extracting dummy coefficients directly from
	###	its model matrix to construct the good model.
	###	Finally, we get lmerTest dfs to calculate the CI

	# Collapse design into one factor (just treating each condition as its

	# Make random effect terms using the dummy variables rather than the big 
	#	'Condition' variable. Per https://rpubs.com/Reinhold/22193, this ensures

	#  be used.
	#	We also specify no random intercepts; because the data are scaled, every
