		<h1>FAQ for prospective PhD students in KU Linguistics</h1>

		<p class="centercol">If you are considering contacting me to inquire about applying for PhD study
			with <a href=".">me</a> in KU Linguistics, the information below may be helpful; your question
			might already be answered there! (You are welcome to contact me anyway with any sort of questions,
			but looking here first may save you time.)</p>
		<p class="centercol"><em>(The information on this page is just a summary of my own experience and views,
			and should not be taken as official advice or policy of our department. The way things work in
			this department may also differ from the way things work in linguistics departments at other
			schools, or in other departments at KU.)</em></p>

<details class="centercol"><summary style="cursor: pointer; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em">Are you currently taking PhD students? / Do you currently have openings for PhD students?</summary><p style="background-color: white; padding: 2em">This actually isn't a very meaningful question for our department. When someone starts a PhD in KU Linguistics, they come in as a student of the whole department, rather than a student of any one particular professor. Over the course of a degree here, a student will take classes with most or all of the faculty members here, and over time will settle on what project(s) they want to do and who they want to do them with. In our department, all of the faculty look at all of the applications, and thus you don't just need to get accepted by me, you need to get accepted by the whole department. If you do get accepted by the department, then during your degree I will be available to work with you if you end up doing a project that it makes sense for me to help with. Therefore, it's not actually necessary to confirm whether I am accepting PhD students before you apply.</p></details>

<details class="centercol"><summary style="cursor: pointer; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em">What can I do to improve my chances of getting accepted? / What are faculty looking for in successful applications?</summary><p style="background-color: white; padding: 2em">Ultimately we're looking for applicants who are likely to be able to succeed in our programme. Our programme focuses heavily on being able to come up with your own novel research ideas in multiple areas of linguistics, and carry out research ideas on them. That means that we're really looking at what kinds of ideas you come up with and how you talk about them. For example, can you explain what's important or interesting about the things you want to do? When asked questions about them, can you answer in ways that show you've that thought a lot about these issues, or that you're open to considering feedback about them? Because this is something we care a lot about, the strength of your ideas will matter a lot more to your application than things like your technical skills. Statements about how many software programmes you know, how many research positions you have held before, etc., will have much less impact on your application than just being able to carry on an interesting conversation about research ideas and make me excited to see where your research will go. This also means that we are evaluating you more on your potential for future research than on your previous research. Having previous research papers or presentations can be one great way to demonstrate your potential, but it's not the only way; an applicant who hasn't published papers but can raise interesting linguistic questions and suggest interesting ways to test them might demonstrate potential better than someone who has published several papers but doesn't have much to say about them.<br /><br />Other than your potential to come up with great research ideas, another thing we care a lot about is "fit", meaning whether we think our department is a good fit for the kind of research you hope to carry out. If your research ideas are about very different kinds of questions than the questions we tend to address, we may be less likely to accept you&mdash;not necessarily because you're a bad candidate, but because we wouldn't feel that we are going to be able to give you the support you need for your research, and we might even worry that you'd eventually be unhappy in a department that's not doing the kind of research you wanted to do.<br /><br />All the above is a very long way of saying: to improve your chances of getting accepted, make sure you are demonstrating your ability to come up with and talk about exciting linguistic questions, and check out <a href="https://linguistics.ku.edu/">our website</a> and our faculty and student profiles to get a sense for what kinds of research we do and see if that fits your interests.</p></details>

<details class="centercol"><summary style="cursor: pointer; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em">Do I need to have a research idea that's related to your research?</summary><p style="background-color: white; padding: 2em">Somewhat, but not exactly. You need to at least have research interests that are roughly in the area or field that me or someone else in the department does. If you are proposing to do, say, historical linguistics, in a department that doesn't have any faculty with substantial expertise in historical linguistics, then you are unlikely to be accepted, simply because the faculty will not feel like they would be able to give you good advice on your research. That said, the research you plan to do doesn't need to be exactly on a topic that I do (or that anyone else does), and doesn't need to be part of "my" research program. Faculty here are committed to helping each student come up with and carry out their own original research projects (and we're excited to learn new things through our involvement in the new research projects our students come up with). So just how related does your research need to be to fall into the "sweet spot" of being related enough to my expertise that I can advise you, without necessarily needing to be exactly what I'd do? This is difficult to quantify (for me it's a bit of an I-know-it-when-I-see-it thing, but that might be harder for you to gauge if you don't have as much experience as I do). As a rule of thumb, I'd say that if your research is not in the realm of psycholinguistics or neurolinguistics I definitely would not be able to offer you much advice, but if it's in psycholinguistics/neurolinguistics and uses a methodology that I use then I probably can offer you advice, even if your research is trying to answer a different question or address a different issue than mine does.</p></details>

<details class="centercol"><summary style="cursor: pointer; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em">Do I need a research proposal?</summary><p style="background-color: white; padding: 2em"></p></details>

<details class="centercol"><summary style="cursor: pointer; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em">What will I do in a PhD, anyway?</summary><p style="background-color: white; padding: 2em"></p></details>

<details class="centercol"><summary style="cursor: pointer; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em">What kind of funding is available?</summary><p style="background-color: white; padding: 2em">More detailed information about this is available on our <a href="https://linguistics.ku.edu/funding">Funding</a> webpage, and we also discuss this at our annual virtual open house in the fall, which I strongly recommend you attend (stay tuned for information about it, or send me an e-mail if you'd like to get a reminder when there's a date scheduled). Long story short, we guarantee full funding (tuition waiver and stipend) for students admitted to the PhD programme, but we do not guarantee funding for students admitted to the MA programme. Funding for PhD students is often via a teaching assistantship, which means that in order to accept the funding you also need to meet the requirements for being a teaching assistant, which include a <a href="https://ogs.ku.edu/ku-procedures-gta-spoken-english-competency">language requirement</a>. (This requirement has problems&mdash;particularly its reliance on <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.715843/full">the problematic concept of "native speaker"</a>, but it's not a requirement that comes from us, it's a requirement imposed on us by non-linguists who run the Kansas university system, so we can't get around it.)</p></details>
