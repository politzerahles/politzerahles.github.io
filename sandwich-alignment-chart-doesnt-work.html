		<h1>The Sandwich Alignment Chart doesn't work</h1>

		<p class="centercol">The Sandwich Alignment Chart, shown below, is great. (I'm not sure where and when it originally came from;
			the earliest appearance I can find is <a href="https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481">this tweet</a>, but
			I don't know if this is really where it comes from.)</p>
		<center><img src="sandwich.png" width=66% title="Sandwich Alignment Chart" alt="" /></center>
		<p class="centercol">As it turns out, however, it doesn't actually work&mdash;by which I mean, it cannot properly capture 
			intuitions about what a sandwich is.</p>
		<p class="centercol"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/4/9/21214870/hot-dog-sandwich-debate-quiz-alignment-website">An essay last year</a>
			already has argued the point that it's hard to logically define the things that we have intuitions about, and thus that
			it's hard to nail down just what constitutes a sandwich. That essay, however, concluded that the Sandwich Alignment Chart is
			good; it suggested that, rather than having a simple yes-or-no debate about whether a hot dog is a sandwich, we should recognize
			there's a range of different ways to understand sandwich-hood, and that the Sandwich Alignment Chart expresses that range.</p>
		<p class="centercol">I would like to go further, though, and contend that even the Sandwich Alignment Chart doesn't get it right&mdash;it
			doesn't capture the range of different people's intuitions about what a sandwich is.
			It fails because of two reasons: entailment, and tradeoffs. Let's look at each of these in turn.</p>

		<h3 class="center">The entailment problem</h3>
		<p class="centercol">The two dimensions of the Sandwich Alignment Chart are both based on what a person accepts as being a 
			sandwich. One end of each scale is more strict (it accepts fewer things as being a sandwich), and one more permissive (it
			accepts more things). The former is a subset of the latter: everything that the permissive end accepts as being a sandwich,
			the strict end also accepts. This is an entailment relationship. Entailment relationships are usually asymmetrical: for example, all dogs
			are mammals (being a dog <em>entails</em> being a mammal) but not all mammals are dogs. In the Sandwich Alignment Chart,
			a "Structure Rebel" accepts everything that a "Structure Purist" accepts, but a "Structure Purist" does not accept
			everything that a "Structure Rebel" accepts. A Structure Purist only accepts something as a sandwich if it's in between
			two pieces of bread; for example, if we look at the left-hand column, a Structure Purist only accepts a BLT as a sandwich,
			and does not accept a sub or a chicken wrap. But a Structure Rebel accepts all those things. If you accept a chicken
			wrap as a kind of sandwich (i.e., if you are a structure rebel), that <em>entails</em> that you also accept subs and
			BLTs as sandwiches.</p>
<!--
 To see this asymmetry, let's just
			look for now at only the left For example, a
			"Structure Purist" only accepts something as a sandwich if it's between two pieces of bread. Looking at only the left column
			of the chart for now: a structure purist only accepts a BLT as a sandwich, and does not accept a sub or a chicken wrap.
			A "Structure Rebel", on the other hand, accepts not just the chicken wrap, but also the sub and the BLT.</p>
-->
		<p class="centercol">This is fundamentally different from the <a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*mAhpwJYwQ7yrZNGUw7GE2Q.jpeg">traditional
			Dungeons & Dragons style alignment charts</a>, which 	involve scales between two opposing options (good vs. evil, law vs.
			chaos) which are not in entailment relationships. In a traditional D&D alignment system, for example, neither good nor
			evil entails the other. A "good" character is one who works to help others, and an "evil" character is one who works to
			help themself. A good knight might throw herself in front of a rampaging ogre to protect a villager;* an evil knight would
			not do that (unless the evil knight saw some benefit for herself in doing so, for instance, to keep up her reputation or
			to get the ogre's loot). An evil thief would steal a treasured gold
			family heirloom from a poor farmer; a good thief would not. Good and evil characters would behave in diametrically
			different ways; it is not the case that an evil character would do all the things a good character would do, or vice
			versa. Thus, it should be clear that this is a different state of affairs than the Sandwich Alignment Chart, where a
			"rebel" would accept everything that a "purist" would accept (and more).</p>
		<p class="centercol">Let's look at what this means in terms of locating oneself, and the kinds of things one accepts as a
			sandwich, on the chart. Imagine you are someone who believes a hot dog is a sandwich, as shown in the chart below. (Note
			that I have modified the chart by removing the labels in the individual cell; here each cell is referring not to a 
			person's own sandwich alignment, but to a category of food items that this person accepts as a sandwich. Accepting a BLT
			as a sandwich does not necessarily mean you are a hardline traditionalist, because <em>everyone</em> accepts that a BLT
			is a sandwich.)</p>
		<center><img src="sandwich2.png" width=66% title="Sandwich Alignment Chart" alt="The Sandwich Alignment Chart, with the center cell (hot dog) circled in red." /></center>
		<p class="centercol">If you think a hot dog is a sandwich, then, because of entailment relationships, you presumably also think
			a chip butty is a sandwich: structurally, it is even more sandwich-like than a hot dog. Likewise, you presumably also 
			think a sub is a sandwich, for the same sort of reason (the ingredients of a sub are even more sandwichy than the
			ingredients of a hot dog). And you certainly think a BLT is a sandwich: it's more sandwich-like
			than a hot dog in terms of both structure and ingredients. Thus, we can more accurately represent the class of things you
			accept as a sandwich with the chart below:</p>
		<center><img src="sandwich3.png" width=66% title="Sandwich Alignment Chart" alt="The Sandwich Alignment Chart, with the center cell (hot dog) and all cells above and/or left of it all circled in red." /></center>
		<p class="centercol">A more general formulation of this is as follows: if you accept a given cell in the chart as a sandwich, then you 
			can extend that to include the full range of cells from that one up to the upper left corner. That's how the entailment relationship
			works. For example, if you accept an ice cream sandwich as a sandwich, then you also accept everything to the left of it.
			If you accept a Pop Tart as a sandwich, then you also accept everything in the entire chart.</p>

		<h3 class="center">Interlude: what I think is a sandwich</h3>
		<p class="centercol">So far, nothing we've seen about entailment is necessarily a problem for the Sandwich Alignment Chart. If
			people's intuitions about sandwich-hood really do follow the entailment patterns described above, then the Sandwich
			Alignment Chart is fine. But do people's intuitions follow that pattern? Here is my own feeling about which things in
			the chart are sandwiches:**</p>
		<center><img src="sandwich4.png" width=66% title="Sandwich Alignment Chart" alt="The Sandwich Alignment Chart. Circled are the entire top row (BLT, chip butty, and ice cream sandwich), plus the leftmost cell of the second row (sub)" /></center>
		<p class="centercol">To me, everything in the top row (BLTs, chip butties, and ice cream sandwiches) is sandwiches, and subs
			are also sandwiches; hot dogs and ice cream tacos, however, are not sandwiches.</p>
		<p class="centercol">This is a problem. This pattern cannot be derived from the entailment relations described above. Or, to
			put it another way: if you follow my abovementioned strategy of selecting a cell and then extending the selection up and
			left, you cannot get this pattern.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Based on what I think is a sandwich, what am I? I can't say I'm ingredient neutral or an ingredient rebel;
			I accept weird ingredients if they're between two things (the top row), but not otherwise. I can't say I'm structure
			neutral; I accept a U-shaped container when it comes to subs, but not hot dogs or Choco Tacos. I also can't say I'm
			a hardline traditionalist, because I accept things outside the upper left cell. The biggest generalization that can
			be made is that I'm <em>not</em> a structure rebel: I don't accept anything in the bottom row. But that still leaves much
			of my pattern unexplained.</p>
		<p class="centercol">To explain my pattern, we have to adopt another element into the theoretical apparatus of sandwich-hood:
			that of tradeoffs.</p>

		<h3 class="center">Tradeoffs</h3>
		<p class="centercol">Tradeoffs, or trading relationships, are common. For example, we can see them in politics. Pundits often
			assume a reductive sort of politics which places people into discrete categories and predicts their behaviour based
			on those categories (e.g., liberal people will do this, moderates will do that, Latinos will do this, whites will do that,
			etc.), while neglecting to consider that everyone has multiple identities. For instance, sure, a particular person
			might be Black, but maybe he's also a man and also a billionaire; his political behaviour (such as voting) might be
			driven more by one of these identities than the other. And such a person may be willing to compromise on one of these
			aspects if it's traded off by another aspect (e.g., in this hypothetical example, the Black billionaire might vote for a
			candidate who supports politics that are harmful to Black people but also supports tax cuts for the ultra-rich).</p>
		<p class="centercol">Another place you see tradeoffs is in speech perception. (I think this is a better example than the
			political one, but is probably only comprehensible to fellow linguists, which is why I chose to include both.) Take,
			for example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4188348/">the perception of certain consonants in Korean</a>. 
			It works a bit differently than in English. In English, if you want to hear the difference between an aspirated and an
			unaspirated consonant (e.g., a "t" vs. a "d"), the main cue you pay attention to is how long of a puff of air there is
			just after the consonant. You can notice this difference if you hold your hand in front of your mouth when saying "da"
			and "ta"; there is a bigger puff of air in "ta". Another way to do it is by holding a piece of paper in front of your
			mouth and seeing that it flutters more when you say "ta" than when you say "da". (I am oversimplifying and ignoring some
			details here.) In Korean, however, to hear the difference between the aspirated and the unaspirated (referred to as
			"lenis" in the study of Korean phonetics) sound, you have to pay attention to two cues: the puff of air, and
			how high-pitched the person's voice is. In Korean, you can't tell the difference between an aspirated and an unaspirated
			sound based on just one cue; the cues trade off against each other, as shown in the graph below. If you hear a sound
			with a medium-ish puff of air, you will hear it as aspirated if it is very high-pitched, but unaspirated if it is
			low-pitched. On the other hand, if the puff of air is longer, then it doesn't need to be so high-pitched for you to
			hear it as aspirated. (Here, too, I am oversimplifying things&mdash;such as the fact that Korean has a third whole
			sound category which English does not&mdash;but that's not relevant for understanding the Sandwich Alignment Chart.)</p>
		<center><img src="korean.png" width=66% title="Korean lenis/aspirated perception" alt="A graph in which the x-axis represents how big a puff of air is, and the y-axis represents how high pitch is. A red triangle labeled \"unaspirated\" fills the bottom left half of the graph, and a blue triangle labeled \"aspirated\" fills the top right half of the graph." /></center>
		<p class="centercol">My intuition about sandwich-hood is clearly another case of a trading relationship. For me to consider
			something a sandwich, I care about both structure and ingredients. But I'm willing to be lenient with one, if the other
			stays more traditional. I will accept a bit of a weird structure as a sandwich, if it has traditional sandwich ingredients
			(e.g., the sub). I will also accept quite weird ingredients, if it has a traditional sandwich structure (i.e., the
			ice cream sandwich). But I can't tolerate too much lenience in both dimensions; if both the structure and the ingredients
			are nontraditional (e.g., a hot dog, or anything below or to the right of that), I won't accept it as a sandwich.</p>
		<p class="centercol">There's also an interesting asymmetry to my trading relationship: I am more tolerant of deviations from
			traditional sandwich ingredients than I am of deviations from traditional sandwich structure. This is demonstrated
			by the fact that I accept ice cream sandwiches, but not chicken wraps, as sandwiches.</p>

		<h3 class="center">Conclusion</h3>
		<p class="centercol">As we have seen, the categories of the Sandwich Alignment Chart, while useful insofar as
			they identify two salient dimensions of what constitutes sandwichhood, do not actually capture how real people 
			understand the category of "sandwich". The dimensions themselves are useful, but if we want to actually understand how
			humans make decisions and judgments and categorizations, we also need a theory of how the dimensions relate to one another,
			and how people weigh them when the dimensions come into conflict (i.e., when something is very sandwich-like on one
			feature but very un-sandwich-like on another). People don't sit in one hard-and-fast alignment box; instead, they have to reconcile multiple
			competing features using some kind of complicated mental process (Virgil Texas of the <em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/badfaithpodcast/posts">Bad Faith</a></em> podcast has referred
			to this as mental "alchemy", in the context of discussing how individual voters weigh all their different concerns in order
			to arrive at a singular decision of whom to vote for in a given election). Fortunately, many social and behavioural sciences,
			including linguistics, psychology, and political science, have theoretical apparatus and research methods for tackling these
			issues. (For instance, in linguistics there is a whole theoretical framework, called <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Optimality+Theory%3A+An+Overview-p-9780631202264">Optimality
			Theory</a>, which is all about how people reconcile conflicting-but-violable constraints.) Thus, to conclude, more
			research on the nature of sandwichhood is needed, and hopefully productive collaborations across these disciplines can
			help us take the next step in resolving these heretofore intractable debates in the sandwich world.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Finally, I must also acknowledge one alternative explanation for the observations described above. One
			could argue that the problem lies not in the Sandwich Alignment Chart, but with my own view of what a sandwich is. In
			other words, maybe the Sandwich Alignment Chart works just fine, but my own mind doesn't work and my idea of what a
			sandwich is is just weird. To which I say, 1) yes, that is logically possible, and 2) rude!</p>
